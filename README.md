## What is Tine?

Tine is a desktop outliner built to look and feel like [Logseq](https://logseq.com) while being
much faster. It operates directly on the standard Logseq graph layout —
`journals/`, `pages/`, `assets/`, and `logseq/config.edn` — so you can point it at the graph you
already use and keep editing in either app (one at a time). Files are written back in
Logseq-compatible markdown, so there's **no import/export step and no lock-in**.

**Why build it?** Logseq's UI is Electron + DataScript with heavy re-rendering, and it gets
sluggish on large graphs. Tine is a ground-up rewrite: a small native shell (Tauri/WebKitGTK), a
pure-Rust core for parsing and indexing, and a fine-grained reactive frontend (SolidJS) that never
diffs a virtual DOM. The editor keeps the live block tree in the frontend, so keystrokes never
round-trip to Rust, and whole-graph reads (search, backlinks, queries) hit an in-memory cache
instead of re-parsing.

> **Status:** a usable daily-driver for outlining, linking, tasks, journals, search, queries, and
> PDF annotation. Linux is the primary, best-tested platform; macOS and Windows builds are produced
> too but are newer. Not yet 1.0 — see [Roadmap](#roadmap--non-goals).

---

## Install

Grab a prebuilt installer from the **[Releases](https://github.com/martinkoutecky/tine/releases)**
page. The builds aren't code-signed yet, so your OS may warn the first time — here's how to get past
it:

- **Linux** — the **AppImage** runs on any distro with no install: `chmod +x Tine_*.AppImage`, then
  run it. Or use the **`.deb`** (Debian/Ubuntu) or **`.rpm`** (Fedora/openSUSE).
- **macOS** — open the **`.dmg`**; on first launch macOS says *"unidentified developer"*, so
  **right-click the app → Open** (just once) and it opens normally after that. If Tine then
  **keeps asking to access your Documents folder on every launch**, see the
  [workaround](#macos-repeated-documents-permission-prompt) below.
- **Windows** — run the **`.exe`** installer; if SmartScreen appears, click **More info → Run
  anyway**. Prefer no installer? Grab the portable **`Tine_*_x64-portable.zip`**, unzip, and run
  `Tine.exe` — it needs the WebView2 runtime, which is preinstalled on Windows 10/11.

(Want to hack on Tine instead? Build from source — see [Build & run](#build--run).)

### macOS: repeated "Documents" permission prompt

If your Logseq graph lives in `~/Documents` (the common default), macOS gates access to that
folder behind a permission prompt. Because the build isn't notarized yet **and** is run with the
download "quarantine" flag, macOS launches it from a randomized temporary location each time
([Gatekeeper App Translocation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2206/_index.html)),
so it can't remember your answer — and re-asks on every launch. To make the grant stick:

1. **Move `Tine.app` into `/Applications`** (drag it out of the disk image / Downloads).
2. Clear the quarantine flag in Terminal:
   ```sh
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Tine.app
   ```
3. Launch Tine from `/Applications` and **Allow** the Documents prompt once — it won't ask again.

(Both this and the "unidentified developer" warning disappear once Tine ships notarized macOS
builds.)

## What Tine adds on top of Logseq

These are the things that started as *"I wish Logseq did this"* — Tine's reasons to exist beyond
raw speed. (Comparisons are against current Logseq desktop core, no plugins.)

- **⚡ Native speed.** Pure-Rust core + SolidJS fine-grained reactivity + a tiny Tauri/WebKitGTK
  runtime instead of Electron — typing stays in the frontend tree, reads hit an in-memory index.
- **🗂️ Built-in tabs.** Middle-click anything to open it in a background tab; pin, drag-reorder,
  `Mod+W` to close, and use the overflow overview when titles no longer fit. (Logseq core has none.)
- **🔎 Search that grows into a query.** Open all Ctrl+K results in a persistent tab, switch the
  same result set between search/list/table/board, refine it with friendly filters or the visual
  builder, and name it only when it deserves to become an ordinary query page.
- **🪟 Split view.** Panes have their own tabs/history, keyboard pane/seam navigation, `Ctrl+click`
  open-to-side, and tab drag to pane or seam.
- **⏯️ Browser-style back/forward** — `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right`, per-tab history, works mid-edit.
- **🎯 Focus mode + dim-inactive-blocks** (`t f` / `t b`) — fade everything but the block you're on.
- **⚡ Global quick-capture** — bind `tine --capture` to a desktop hotkey and a small always-on-top
  box pops from *any* app with the full editor, filing a bullet to today's journal.
- **🔁 Carry unfinished tasks forward** to today (last 7 / 30 / 365 days, or a configurable N).
- **▦ Sheets** — recursive grids, markdown databases, typed field tables, formula columns + filters with a visual builder, task/tag boards, aggregates, colors, and CSV import over plain bullets.
- **📖 In-app Guide** — Help → Guide opens bundled, read-only how-to pages beside your own
  graph, and **Copy the guide into your graph** creates an editable, interlinked
  `tine-guide/…` sandbox without touching the originals.
- **🛟 A real data-safety story** — conflict detection instead of silent overwrites, launch
  snapshots with one-click restore, and delete-to-trash; built to live safely on a graph you also
  edit from Logseq mobile over Syncthing.
- **👋 First-run onboarding** — a Welcome screen that opens an existing graph or creates a new one
  pre-loaded with a short, narrated demo graph (which opens in Logseq too).

## Features

A quick map of what's in the box — the **[full feature list lives in docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md)**,
and the **[demo](https://tine.page/demo/)** shows the rendered-content side of it in your browser.

| Area | Highlights |
|------|-----------|
| **Outliner** | Click-to-edit with exact caret landing, Logseq keyboard semantics, zoom, drag-reorder, multi-block select; in-block lists & checklists; callouts; a live `/calc` block. |
| **Media** | Paste/import images, video & audio; configurable asset names; drag-resize images *and* video; an audio waveform overlay player; image lightbox; orphaned-media cleanup. |
| **Links, refs & queries** | `[[page]]` · `#tag` · `((block ref))` · `{{embed}}` with autocomplete; live linked/unlinked references; per-block ref counts; one query engine behind friendly filters, a visual builder, raw DSL and search/list/table/board views; a scoped Datalog path. |
| **Tasks, journals & dates** | Task workflows + priorities, scheduled/deadline with a date picker, recurring tasks, carry-forward, a multi-day journal feed, agenda, and a calendar. |
| **PDF** | Zoomable virtualized viewer, in-PDF find, text + area (image) highlights stored Logseq-compatibly, each a bullet you can annotate. |
| **Search & nav** | `Ctrl+K` switcher (titles + full text) with persistent result tabs, bounded match evidence and query-page promotion; command palette, in-app Guide, namespace tree, tabs, split view, back/forward, focus mode, global quick-capture, page icons. |
| **Your files** | Safe to run alongside Logseq mobile over Syncthing — conflict detection, format-preserving atomic saves, transactional rename, org-mode (byte-faithful or read-only), snapshots + trash. |
| **Customize & export** | Remappable shortcuts with `?` help, built-in theme gallery + custom CSS, multi-language spell check, static HTML export with offline search, copy/export as Markdown, **export a page to PDF**. |

→ **[See every feature, with the details, in docs/FEATURES.md.](docs/FEATURES.md)**
→ **[Tine vs Logseq, feature by feature](https://tine.page/compare.html)** — an honest, dated
comparison: parity, scoped, not-yet, and what Tine deliberately doesn't do.

## Built with

| Layer | Tech | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Shell | [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) (Rust) | OS webview (WebKitGTK on Linux) — tiny runtime vs Electron |
| Frontend | [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com) + TypeScript + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) | fine-grained reactivity, no virtual-DOM churn |
| Core | `crates/tine-core` (pure Rust) | parse/serialize, model, indexing, queries, refs, dates, PDF/EDN, HTML publish |
| Rendering | [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), [KaTeX](https://katex.org), highlight.js | PDF, math, code |

The Rust core is GUI-free and unit-tested in isolation; the Tauri layer is a thin set of ~41 IPC
commands over it. The frontend owns the live editing tree (normalized store) and pushes debounced,
format-preserving saves; whole-graph reads hit an in-memory page cache (`RwLock<Arc<Graph>>` — read
commands clone the Arc and release the lock immediately) keyed by a graph generation counter.

The bigger architectural choices — Tauri/WebKitGTK over Electron, the pure-Rust core, in-browser
WASM parsing, the data-safety invariants — are written up as short decision records in
[`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).

## Project layout

```
crates/tine-core/    Rust core: parse/serialize, model, config, dates, refs, query, pdf, edn, publish
src-tauri/           Tauri app — IPC commands + windows (main + quick-capture)
src/                 SolidJS frontend (components, store, render pipeline, keybindings)
scripts/             env.sh (toolchain paths), screenshot generators
docs/                Logo, images, FEATURES.md, ADRs, feature notes
samples/             Demo graph used by tests/screenshots
```

## Build & run

```bash
source scripts/env.sh        # toolchain env (CARGO_HOME/RUSTUP_HOME, CARGO_TARGET_DIR, lib paths)
npm install                  # first time

# Build the release binary (NOT plain `cargo build` — that produces a dev-mode
# binary that can't connect to the bundled frontend):
npx tauri build --no-bundle

# Run it against your graph:
TINE_GRAPH=/path/to/your/graph ./target/release/tine
```

> `env.sh` points `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` at the persistent `.toolchain/` mount and symlinks `./target`
> to it, so a `git clean` or a fresh session reuses the warm build cache instead of recompiling from
> scratch (`./target/release/…` still resolves through the symlink).

### Release checklist

Before tagging a release, run `npm run e2e:caret` against the release binary to
guard the ADR 0013 duplicate-instance caret/focus invariant.

- Point `TINE_GRAPH` at the same `journals/` + `pages/` + `logseq/config.edn` tree you use with
  Logseq. **Run one app at a time** on a given graph.
- **GPU compositing (smooth scrolling) is on by default.** On the rare GPU/compositor combo where
  WebKitGTK's DMABUF renderer aborts (the window fails to appear, or you see
  `EGL_BAD_PARAMETER` on the console), set `TINE_GPU=0` to fall back to software rendering — slower,
  but it always starts. If Tine detects it's painting on the CPU it now says so with a banner.
- Prefer the **raw binary** over an AppImage on Linux — an AppImage's bundled graphics libraries can
  clash with the host GPU and silently drop you to (slow) software rendering. The `.deb`/`.rpm`
  packages use your system's drivers and don't have this problem.

### Troubleshooting a bad startup (debug mode)

If Tine won't start cleanly (e.g. the window never appears), run it with debug logging on. It writes
a timestamped trace to a file — the environment (renderer, session type, AppImage, graph), every
startup milestone, any panic (with backtrace), and the frontend's own boot/errors — so one file is
usually enough to diagnose it:

```bash
TINE_DEBUG=1 tine                 # or:  tine --debug
TINE_DEBUG=1 ./Tine-*.AppImage    # AppImage
```

Tine prints the log path on startup; it defaults to `/tmp/tine-debug.log` (override with
`TINE_DEBUG_LOG=/path`). Reproduce the problem, then send that file. The log records no note content
— only startup diagnostics.

**Quick capture** — at the top of the journal feed, a page-title field + a body composer: fill the
title to capture a **new page**, leave it empty to **append to today**, then `Ctrl-Shift-Enter`.
**Global quick-capture:** bind your desktop environment's keyboard settings to run
`tine --capture` (a second launch is routed to the running instance via single-instance).

### Develop

```bash
npm run dev                  # frontend only, in a browser, against an in-memory mock backend
npm run app                  # full Tauri dev window  (alias for: tauri dev)
node scripts/screenshot.mjs  # regenerate screenshots from the mock backend
```

## Testing

```bash
source scripts/env.sh
cargo test -p tine-core      # Rust: parse/serialize round-trip, model, queries, search cache
npm test                     # Frontend: Vitest (editor ops, outline, autocomplete, markers, …)
```

Round-trip parsing is validated against a real Logseq graph (0 structural diffs beyond accepted
canonicalization); `tine-check` is a privacy-safe profiler that proves byte-faithful serialization
without reading note content.

## Community

Questions, ideas, screenshots, and bug reports are welcome on the subreddit:
**[r/TineOutline](https://www.reddit.com/r/TineOutline/)** — the best place to follow what's
shipping and help shape what's next. For concrete bugs or feature requests you can also
[open an issue](https://github.com/martinkoutecky/tine/issues).

## Contributing

Tine is a single-maintainer project with an unusual contribution model: **the most valuable thing
you can send is testing and bug reports**, and code changes come in as **proposals/specs the
maintainer implements** rather than merged patches (docs/typo PRs excepted). The why, and how to
file a good report, are in **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

## Roadmap & non-goals

**New — Sheets (2-D grids + databases):** render a block's children as a recursive,
editable TreeSheets-style grid, field table, or board — while everything stays plain
Logseq markdown/org (see [FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md#sheets-2-d-grids)). It includes
typed schemas, query-driven tables, task/tag boards, grouping, aggregates, markdown table
conversion, computed columns with a visual formula builder, filters, and CSV/TSV import.

**New — Split view:** panes with their own tabs/history, TreeSheets-style pane and seam
navigation, `Ctrl+click` open-to-side, and tab drag to panes/seams (see
[FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md#split-view)).

**Planned / under evaluation:** graph view and configurable typographic auto-replace.

**Mobile:** Tine has a **native Android build** (Tauri v2) as of 0.4.0 — it opens and edits your real
Logseq graph on the phone over your own sync, alongside the Logseq mobile app. iOS is being scoped.

**Next — Plugins (0.6.x):** a capability-limited plugin system is planned, starting with real
extensions that help define a stable API without giving plugins unrestricted access to the graph
or host.

**Under discussion, not promised:** built-in git integration.

**Out of scope (by design):** whiteboards and flashcards.

The full working backlog — what's next, what's deferred, and what's explicitly WONTFIX — lives in
[`docs/BACKLOG.md`](docs/BACKLOG.md).

## Support

Tine is free, open source, and built in the cracks of a busy life. If it's made your notes a little
faster or your day a little smoother, and you'd like to say thanks with a coffee — that genuinely
makes me happy, and I'm grateful. Anything donated goes first toward Tine's running costs — the
domain, and things like app-store registration fees down the line.

One honest thing, so there are no crossed wires: **donating won't move Tine up my list, and it won't
buy a feature.** I work on Tine when I can and on what I find worth doing — a tip changes none of
that. Think of it as a thank-you for what already exists, not a down payment on what's next. No
expectations, no obligations, either way. 🌱
