/**
 * A region that fails says so, in place, and offers to try again.
 *
 * Why this exists at all. Solid discards the WHOLE pending effect queue when a
 * render throws — `runUpdates` (solid-js 1.9.13, dist/solid.js:820) does
 * `if (!wait) Effects = null;` before it calls `handleError`, and `handleError`
 * RETHROWS when no boundary is registered. Tine registered none anywhere, so a
 * single unreadable value had three consequences at once: every effect batched
 * with it was dropped, including effects belonging to components that were
 * fine; the throw left the window as an uncaught error, which a Tauri webview
 * shows the user nothing about; and nothing rescheduled the discarded work, so
 * the app stayed blank until restart. GH #490 diagnosed exactly this inside the
 * conflict panel and worked around it locally; GH #332 is a user who has been
 * on an old release since August because his whole app came up empty and told
 * him nothing.
 *
 * What a boundary does and does not buy. `Effects = null` runs BEFORE
 * `handleError`, so co-batched effects are still lost — a boundary does not
 * make the tear disappear. What it does is stop the rethrow, render this
 * fallback, and let later updates run normally: permanent silent blank becomes
 * a visible message plus a way forward.
 *
 * Retry is the point, not a decoration. Solid's reset re-evaluates
 * `props.children`, so the subtree remounts and the resources inside it are
 * created afresh and refetch. For a failure whose cause was transient — a
 * command that lost a race with a 37-second startup — retrying is the whole
 * fix, and the user can apply it without knowing any of the above.
