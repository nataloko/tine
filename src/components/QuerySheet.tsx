// **The query builder's two states (SPEC §7.2, design §2.1).**
//
// At rest a query block is one plain-English SENTENCE — typography, not a
// control panel. Editing expands a SHEET below it: the anchor line, one row per
// condition, and the view controls in its footer. The chip bar this replaced
// was a permanently visible widget per part of every leaf, which is the shape
// every product in the design survey with a nine-controls-per-row filter panel
// has, and it is the shape a phone cannot draw.
//
// Three properties this file is responsible for:
//
//  - **Bounded rendering (I-22).** Everything here — rows, group nesting,
//    sentence segments, the `⟨advanced⟩` chip's own text — stops at
//    `MAX_QUERY_BUILDER_DEPTH`. A 64-deep query still parses, still runs and
//    still round-trips; it just draws as a short sentence and a short sheet.
//  - **No graph-level work on a render path (I-13).** The registry is read once
//    when the sheet opens, never per row and never per keystroke. The facets
//    resource is the host's, and it is keyed `undefined` until a sheet opens.
//  - **One dismissal ladder (GH #472).** Every menu in here registers with
//    `registerVisiblePopover` under the sheet's own layer id, so Escape, Android
//    Back and an outside press close the innermost thing first.

// `stop` and the listbox keyboard/ARIA controller live in `QueryListbox.tsx`
// now: P4's vocabulary picker needs the SAME controller over a virtualized list
// body, and a second arrow-key implementation for it is the twin D-14 forbids
// (N1). They are re-exported here because this module is where the sheet's
// callers already import them from.

 *  holds one shared read and hands it down.
 *
 *  Two things moved in P4. The read is now the sheet's ONLY graph-level
