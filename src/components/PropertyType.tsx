 * `due date` has the row `due-date`. Re-implementing that here would be a second
 * producer of a question Rust already answers, and the two would drift on

 *
 * So this does not normalize: it MATCHES. The picker's keys come from
 * `query_facets`, the registry's rows carry their own `normalized_name`, and an
 * exact hit is the answer. The one relaxation is a display-only fallback for the
 * common shapes (case, surrounding space, ` `/`_` in place of `-`); when even
 * that finds nothing the caller says "no observed values" and shows no type,
 * which is honest. Every WRITE uses the matched row's `normalized_name`

 *
 * The engine has computed all of this since P0 — observed type, cardinality,
 * `mismatch_count`, and the declared override read off the key's own page — and
 * nothing in the UI ever looked. This is the whole surface: what a key's type
 * IS, whether anything disagrees with it, and the one action that changes it.
 *
 * Two decisions worth stating, because both are easy to get subtly wrong:
 *
 *  - **A mismatch count is only shown against a DECLARED type.** The registry
 *    computes `mismatch_count` against the *effective* type, which is the
 *    declared one when a declaration exists and the observed majority
 *    otherwise. "3 blocks don't match the majority" is not a defect — it is
 *    what an untyped graph looks like — so showing it would be noise the user
 *    cannot act on. Against a type the user themselves declared it is exactly
 *    the actionable thing.
 *  - **The declaration is written on the row's `normalized_name`, verbatim.**
 *    The engine binds a declaration by `refs::page_key(normalized_name)`, so a
 *    key authored `due date` must be declared on the page `due-date`; a page
 *    literally named `due date` would never bind and the user would be left
 *    with a declaration that does nothing.
