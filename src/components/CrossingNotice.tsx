/** **The user half of the persisted-form crossing (SPEC §4.3 "Notice", §7.5).**
 *
 *  The mechanical half already shipped: an edit the OG DSL cannot express turns
 *  a `{{query …}}` block into `{{tine-query …}}` on save. That is the right
 *  behaviour — the alternative is dropping the user's edit — but it changes what
 *  the block looks like *in Logseq*, silently, as a side effect of an ordinary
 *  edit. So it is said out loud, with the way back attached.
 *
 *  Three deliberate shapes:
 *
 *  1. **Not a toast.** P4 hosts this same component inside the query pane it
 *     builds, so it is an inline region that takes its position from its host.
 *     A toast would also be gone before a reader who looked away came back.
 *  2. **The feature is NOT named in P2.** The engine's answer here is a bare
 *     `og_expressible` bool, and the OG printer's refusal says only "this
 *     filter" / "this view". Re-deriving OG-expressibility over the TypeScript
 *     IR mirror to produce a name would be a second producer of a question Rust
 *     owns (D-14) — the exact class of twin this campaign deleted. `feature` is
 *     the seam P4 fills from the pane's diagnostics without the text moving.
 *  3. **Undo is the ordinary undo**, gated on the ordinary undo actually being
 *     this change (`canUndo`). There is no targeted-inverse mechanism: an undo
 *     that reached past a later edit to reverse an older one would be a new and
 *     much more dangerous kind of undo.
