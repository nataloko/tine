//
// This file is the HOST. It owns the session, the two graph-level reads, the
// anchor-switch preview and the dismissal layer; `QuerySheet.tsx` owns what the

 *  the same question in both, so it is answered once (I-12). The dialect is an
 *  input, not a second pane.
 *
 *  The contract it implements, from §4.3.1:
 *
 *  - A failed parse **keeps the draft and the last-good session**, shows the
 *    parser's OWN message, and disables save. It never blanks the pane and never
 *    writes to disk. The bar above renders greyed while this holds, so the rows
 *    on screen are visibly "what still ran", not "what you just typed".
 *  - **I-20, tightened.** The pane used to accept any response NEWER than the
 *    last one it settled. That is not enough: with revisions 1 and 2 both in
 *    flight, 1's answer arrives, is newer than the watermark, and lands — so the
 *    rows and the error briefly describe text the user has already replaced, and
 *    a *successful* 1 clears the error 2 is about to raise. A response is now
 *    accepted only when it is the answer to the CURRENT revision, on a session
 *    that is still the pane's, in a pane that has not been disposed. Everything
 *    else is dropped, on the success path and the failure path alike.
 *  - Saving waits for a successful parse of the CURRENT revision, so a pending
 *    or invalid draft disables save. **A save can never write an earlier good
 *    parse**: the last-good reading is remembered for the rows, but the button
 *    is enabled only while the good parse IS the current revision.
 *  - Closing the sheet disposes the pane, and a pending callback that lands
 *    afterwards calls no host prop.
 *  - The pane is not an options editor. */
