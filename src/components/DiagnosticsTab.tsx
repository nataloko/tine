        Tine keeps a small, bounded flight recorder of this run and the previous one, including

        It does not record graph content, file paths, page titles, queries, URLs, credentials, or
        the detailed opt-in debug log. It is kept in Tine's private app data (at most 1 MiB), never
        in your graph, and nothing is uploaded. You choose whether to copy or save a report and
        share it.

        A report also carries statistics about your graph, such as how long each step of opening
        it took and the sizes of its pages, as numbers only. They never include a page name, any
