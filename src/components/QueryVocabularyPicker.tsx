// **The one vocabulary picker (SPEC §7.5, §6.4, I-13, I-22).**
//
// Before this there were two choosers and neither showed the graph. Adding a
// condition asked for a TYPE first ("Property"), then for a KEY, from
// `query_facets` — a whole-graph key/value scan whose answer carried no counts,
// no types and no ordering, so the list was alphabetical noise in which a key
// used 400 times sat below one used once. Changing a row's field asked the same
// question through a second control.
//
// This is one list, and it is the registry's (§6.1): the observed type, the
// authoritative count and the common values the engine has already computed.
// Three properties it is responsible for:
//
//  - **Observation and coercion are different things, and both are labelled.**
//    The row says what the graph LOOKS like (`observed`) and, when the key
//    carries a `tine.type` declaration, what the engine will COERCE by
//    (`declared`). Operators and value encoding still come from
//    `effectiveTypeOf` — the display never decides a comparison (§6.3).
//  - **A count is authoritative or it is absent.** Built-in task markers and
//    page predicates are not registry rows; the registry holds no statistics for
//    them, and inventing one — or borrowing a same-named property's — would be a
//    number the user could act on and the engine never said. Their rows carry
//    no second line at all.
//  - **Bounded rendering (I-22).** A graph with thousands of property keys
//    mounts a viewport's worth of rows plus overscan, through
//    `@tanstack/solid-virtual`. The keyboard, the roving active option and the
//    `aria-activedescendant` wiring are `QueryListbox`'s, unchanged (D-14, N1);
//    this file replaces the list BODY and the data adapter, nothing else.

/**
 * **The rows for a key the user TYPED, one per scope it is not already in.**
 *
 * A query may name a property before the graph has one, and — the case that got
 * lost when the two-stage chooser went away — it may name a key the graph has
 * on the OTHER kind of owner. `PropertyKeyPick` used to be reached through two
 * separate field kinds, `property` and `pageProperty`, so any typed key could be
 * authored either way; one list keyed off `registryRowFor` gave back neither. A
 * key written only on pages was unauthorable as a block property, and a brand
 * new key was authorable only as a block one.
 *
 * So the offer is per SCOPE, and it is made exactly where the scope's own
 * section does not already carry the key:
 *
 *  - `@block` offers the block's own property and the owning page's property;
 *  - `@page` has one scope, so it offers one choice (F5: there is no reading a
 *    page's property "through" a page).
 *
 * **Counts are the registry's or they are absent.** A key with a row and
 * `count_blocks == 0` is honestly `0 blocks today` in the block scope — that is
 * the registry's own number, and the scope label says which question it answers.
 * A key with no row at all is 0 for the same reason. But while `rows` is
 * `undefined` the read has not landed, and 0 would be a claim about a graph
 * nobody has looked at yet, so the row carries NO count and both scopes are
 * offered — a pending registry is not a known-empty one.
 *
 * Duplicate detection stays `registryRowFor`, the existing matcher, because
 * normalizing a key is the engine's job and a second normalizer here would
 * disagree with it on exactly the keys that matter (D-14).
