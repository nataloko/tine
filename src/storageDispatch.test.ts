// Route-level capability guard for the storage-authority front door (I-6).
//
// The claim this file enforces is a REACHABILITY claim, not a naming one: for
// every published admission, `src/storageDispatch.ts` invokes exactly one arm,
// and under a managed binding the Direct arm is unreachable. A name-grep cannot
// prove that (aliasing evades it); exercising the dispatcher with each
// admission and letting the wrong arm throw can.
//
// If you are adding a semantic storage operation, add its front door to
// `src/storageDispatch.ts` and its rows here — do not branch on
// `applicationPageAdmission` at your call site.
