// The last error messages Tine showed in this session, for Settings → Help &
// diagnostics (Martin, 2026-09-29). An error toast is sticky and copyable, but
// once closed its text is gone; this keeps the newest few so a report can still
// be written after the toast was dismissed.
//
// Question answered: "which error messages did this session show, and when?"
// Fed by the one error-toast recorder hook (`recordErrorToastsWith`, wired in
// debug.ts). In memory only, by design: the messages may name pages or paths, so
// they never reach the flight recorder, the debug log store, storage or the
// backend. A guard test pins that this module imports nothing that could write.
//
// Cost: O(limit) per error; bounded at 20 short strings. No persisted record.
