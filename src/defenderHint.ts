/** The one-time "Windows Defender is slowing this graph down" hint (GH #623).
 *
 *  Question answered: after a graph opens, should Tine tell the user that
 *  Defender real-time protection is probably why a cold load was slow, and what
 *  happened when they chose to act on it?
 *
 *  Rules. The backend decides (Windows only, real-time protection on, a slow
 *  cold load, not dismissed for this graph); this module only shows the answer.
 *  Nothing changes Defender without a click, and the exclusion is a UAC prompt
 *  of the user's own accord. Dismissal is per graph and stored by the backend
 *  (`notices.json`, never in the graph). An unreadable answer costs no hint:
 *  recovery over refusal (a missing hint never harms the graph). */
