// File-size ratchet: budget B1 of the consolidation plan (2026-09-15).
//
// Rule: no production source file above 4,000 lines and no test file above
// 16,000. A file that was already larger when this ratchet landed is pinned at
// that length, and the pin is a ceiling that may only fall. When a seam cut
// moves code out of a pinned file, lower its pin in the same commit. A pin
// above the file's real length fails too, so a gain cannot be quietly spent.
//
// Why a hard number: `model.rs` reached 25,000 lines one reasonable addition at
// a time, because agents put new code next to the similar code they are
// reading. A cap turns "append it here" into "find the seam". A cut is a
// legibility gain even when it moves zero net lines (Martin, 2026-09-12).
//
// Shape to imitate: `crates/tine-core/src/query/`, one parent module with
// focused children (`sql.rs`, `results.rs`, `rank.rs`) at minimal visibility.
