/** The document module: the frontend's loaded pages, every edit to them, undo,
 * and their persistence. This file is the only door; production code outside
 * src/document imports from here (guard: boundary.guard.test.ts).
 * SURFACE.txt lists every export; new exports after batch 02b need a `# why:` justification.
 *
 * Reading. `existingBlockId(raw, format, facts?)` reads authored identity from
 * an exact buffer; editor facts take precedence and mismatched facts throw.
 * O(block bytes): loaded parser-owned absence avoids a parse; unknown/possible
 * identity uses cached parser regions. Callers need no knowledge of the seeds.
 * `node(id)`, `childIds`, `pageRoots`, `loadedPage`, `feedNames`,
 * `isLoaded` read the live Solid store on each call. Call them inside a tracking
 * scope (JSX, memo, effect) to re-render on change; a value read once in setup
 * is a snapshot, not a subscription. Returned values are readonly.
 * `loadRoutedPage` admits the first routed graph page and enables saves even
 * when no journal feed has loaded; O(blocks of that page), and an unsafe
 * replacement leaves the current edit intact. Satellite/scratch loads use
 * `ensurePageLoaded` and cannot enable persistence.
 *
 * `selectionMarkdown(includeSubtree?)` returns public clipboard Markdown in
 * selected-root order, honoring the copy preference unless overridden. Cuts
 * pass true to include every removed descendant. O(visible-order resolution + selected subtree bytes);
 * an empty selection returns an empty string; no save or undo side effects.
 *
 * Editing. Change a page only through an intent exported here (`setRaw`,
 * `splitBlock`, `moveBlock`, `setBlockProperty`, ...). An intent updates the
 * model and marks the page dirty; user edits also record undo (`ensureBlockId`
 * stamps an id without undo). `withUndoUnit` groups the synchronous mutations
 * of its callback into one undo step; it does not span awaits. A new intent
 * lives in the matching `edits/*.ts` file. In-memory-only changes (no save, no undo):
 * `revealNode` (expand for find) and the page-header edit begin/finish pair.
 * `sanitizeOutlineIdsForPaste` prepares an ID-bearing ordinary paste by checking
 * loaded blocks and backend ID lookups in chunks of at most 128 IDs. Each lookup
 * can scan graph pages in memory and read pages for IDs it cannot place; paid per explicit paste
 * that carries IDs, never per keystroke or save;
 * it returns null when the target graph changes and strips uncertain IDs on a
 * lookup failure. The caller needs no knowledge of which pages are loaded.
 * `blockPositionRef` and `settleBlockRef` let a saved session name an ID-less
 * zoomed block by position: navigation never writes an `id::`. `persistBlockRefTarget` validates the target
 * before a source edit, then saves the target ID before the source reference
 * in one ordered group. A crash between those writes may leave an unreferenced
 * ID, never a dangling reference. Failure returns null or false. Cost is one
 * page or grouped save, plus a page lookup when the target is not loaded.
 * `ensurePagePropertyOnKeyPage` writes a property declaration on its normalized
 * key page: one page read, then one guarded page edit. It rejects
 * graph changes, conflicts and read-only pages; callers report the error.
 *
 * Saving. Pages save as whole-page snapshots, never as operations. `markDirty`
 * requires an edit kind and schedules a trailing 400 ms save, capped at 3 s
 * from the first dirty mark of a burst;
 * the request carries distinct kinds in first-seen order. A lazy page also
 * declares `create-page` on its first save. Multi-page intents call
 * `persistTogether` with kinds inside the document module: their pages enter one open
 * group, overlapping groups merge, and the group sends one sinks-first
 * `savePages` request. A sealed request chains before later edits of its pages;
 * a new multi-page edit forms a successor group. Saves use the revision last
 * read, so an external file change surfaces a reasoned conflict rather than
 * an overwrite. `resolveConflict` reloads the pinned file for Use disk, or
 * guards Keep mine with the disk revision observed when the conflict arose;
 * a later disk edit raises a fresh conflict. For an alias-owner draft, Keep mine
 * appends the draft to the owner's current content at that observed revision.
 * `flushPage` / `flushAll` wait for
 * pending requests. An incomplete page-header draft remains dirty without an
 * autosave toast; exiting that editor reports invalid syntax once. A crash
 * between file writes can duplicate a moved block, but sinks-first order keeps
 * it on at least one file for acyclic moves (I-3). Creating a page file
 * goes through `createPage`, which refuses locally with a typed
 * `CreatePageRefusal`, distinct from a disk conflict. Only save/engine.ts calls
 * the backend's savePages/deletePage (I-1). Direct native page writers declare
 * their fixed kinds at their backend call and store entry. This adds O(1) kind
 * bookkeeping per edit and no disk bytes; missing kinds are refused before a
 * save request. Callers need no knowledge of the debounce or save group state.
 *
 * Outside changes. `applyGraphChange` handles one watcher event using
 * `reloadDisposition`: an own-save echo keeps content and undo; a clean page
 * reloads, unless it is being edited or moved (then the change is skipped); a
 * dirty, saving or conflicted page becomes a conflict, including when its file
 * was removed; a clean removed page that is not being edited leaves its route;
 * results that land after a graph switch are dropped (I-20). This module never imports the router: route
 * and feed effects go through handlers the app installs
 * (`installExternalChangeUiHandler`, `installAliasDraftRouteHandler`,
 * `installHistoryRouteContextAdapter`). An effective title change uses the
 * exact physical path to rekey navigation, loaded page ownership and its save
 * baseline in that order. The UI installs `installPageIdentityNavigation`;
 * rekeying refuses a name collision or an unsafe external reload.
 * `applyGraphChangesBulk` applies a checkout-sized batch with one revision
 * bump, at most one feed restart and one summary toast. With "always ask"
 * (conflictPolicy.ts) the one silent case, a loaded clean page, is held for its
 * bar instead; `replayDeferredExternalReloads` is the focus-return sweep. */
