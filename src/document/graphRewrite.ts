 * Backend errors reject. After a rename or merge, drop the pages it moved under
 * their old names, reload the clean pages it rewrote (their undo is dropped),
 * and refresh navigation; every other loaded page keeps its state, unsaved
 * edits and undo included. `unchanged` touches nothing.
 * Cost grows with graph pages and references, plus one page read per loaded
 * rewritten page. A backend failure can require inspecting disk before
 * retrying. The rename's own write and its bookkeeping (forgetting moved
 * pages, reloading rewritten ones) are owned by the graph binding (R4), so a
 * repaint during the rename cannot skip them. The refresh retires every
 * display owner captured before it, so a caller that must act on success (open
 * the page, confirm) receives the display owner captured after the refresh
 * through `onRefreshed`. Navigation in that
 * callback shares the refresh batch, so views read only the final route. */
