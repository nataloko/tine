// Family 10 — reload on focus (Concord L0; master d56219d73, b3d64addee39).
//
// The watcher is the primary freshness path and stays so. Some filesystems and
// sync clients deliver no event at all (network mounts, a client writing
// through a path the kernel does not report, an app the OS suspended while the
// user was elsewhere), and then a page can sit stale indefinitely. The one
// signal always available is the user coming back to the window. Neither step
// below is a new freshness path:
//  1. `replayDeferredExternalReloads()` replays reloads deferred mid-edit
//     (deferredReload.ts) whose page is replaceable now;
//  2. `rescanGraphNow()` asks the BACKEND watcher for one full stat diff.
//     What it finds is emitted as ordinary `graph-changed` events, so the
//     reload disposition and the deferred replay apply as for a live event.
// Typing is never blocked by observation (SPEC-storage §6.1, K22): while the
// rescan runs the editor stays live, and a stale-base save is refused by the
// base-revision guard and becomes a conflict, never a silent overwrite. A
// rescan slower than 500 ms only says so (`refreshingFromDisk`, a dim
// status in the lower-right corner beside the help button). Throttled: a
// focus is a gesture users make constantly, and a rescan costs one stat per
// graph-text file. Coalesced: a focus during a rescan of the same graph joins it.
