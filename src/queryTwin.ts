/** GH #619 item 9 ("Pages and blocks"): the OTHER anchor's reading of one query's conditions.
 *
 *  One place computes it for both the block's own results (Macro.tsx) and the sheet's live preview
 *  (QueryLivePreview.tsx), so the two cannot disagree about what "both families" means. The same
 *  conditions are re-read under the other anchor by the ENGINE exactly as the sheet's anchor switch
 *  does (print, then parse): a leaf that does not apply there comes back as a diagnostic, never as a
 *  frontend guess (§7.4, D-14). The IR's anchor is never flipped directly.
 *
 *  Truncation is per family. The engine never truncates silently for size (an over-bound family
 *  rejects the whole run as `result-too-large`); what it does drop is rows a `sample` removed, and it
 *  reports the pre-sample count as `matched_total`. A family is "cut off" when that count exceeds the
 *  rows it returned, compared BEFORE the host block is taken out of the shown rows. */
