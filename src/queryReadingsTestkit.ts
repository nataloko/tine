// How the ONE engine reads a macro argument — stated explicitly, for tests.
//
// The frontend no longer decides where a trailing options map begins, nor
// whether a `{{query …}}` holds the legacy DSL or advanced datalog. `query_parse`
// answers both, in Rust (SPEC §7.1, X4; I-12). `src/mock.ts` deliberately cannot
// answer them — it has no parser, and a copy of one is exactly the twin this
// packet deleted — so it retains the whole argument verbatim as `source.original`
// with no options.
//
// That is the honest behaviour of a backend with no engine, but it means a test
// that depends on either reading has to SAY what the engine answers, instead of
// relying on a frontend regex it can no longer reach. This helper is that
// statement: a table from macro argument to the reading, with no parsing of any
// kind. An argument the table does not mention is a test asking for a reading it
// never declared, and it throws rather than guessing.
