// The anonymized-graph acceptance gate for GH #164's property writers.
//
// **Why this exists as a permanent, env-gated test.** The corpus discipline is
// that synthetic fixtures are generated from *our model of a graph* - the same
// model that produced the bug - so a packet touching a save path takes a real
// graph as an acceptance gate. That gate is worth nothing if it is a one-off
// script that vanishes with the packet. This is the TypeScript analogue of
// `crates/tine-core/src/direct_move_recovery_corpus_tests.rs`, whose `#[ignore]`
// is spelled `describe.skipIf` here: absent ANON_GRAPH it does not run, and it
// is never part of the fast loop.
//
// **It contains no corpus content, and must never grow any.** The graph is named
// by `ANON_GRAPH` and is only ever READ - these writers are pure functions over
// strings, so unlike the Rust gate there is nothing to copy and nothing that can
// mutate the corpus. Every assertion is on a COUNT, never on corpus text: a bare
// `expect(actual).toBe(expected)` would print page bytes into a failure message,
// and this file is committed and public while the corpus is not. Counters only.
//
// Run it with:
//
//   ANON_GRAPH=~/research/logseq-anonymized npx vitest run src/propertyWriterCorpus.test.ts
//
// **Known limit, stated so a green run is not over-read:** this corpus is all
// Markdown (1075 `.md`, 0 `.org`), so it cannot exercise the Org page-property
// directive writer from the same packet. Org stays proven at the unit layer
// (`orgPreBlockWithProperty` in src/editor/properties.test.ts, and the org page
// write in src/store.test.ts). A gate cannot prove what its corpus lacks.
