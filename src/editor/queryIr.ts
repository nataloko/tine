// **The TypeScript mirror of the Rust query IR** (SPEC §3.1, §7.1).
//
// One query language, defined once, in `crates/tine-core/src/query/ir.rs`. This
// file is the JSON shape of that value as it crosses Tauri — nothing more. It
// declares no semantics, parses no text and prints no text: `query_parse`,
// `query_print` and `query_og_expressible` are the only things that produce or
// interpret an IR, and they all live in Rust (D-14 — the frontend's second
// grammar is what this packet exists to remove).
//
// ## Why it is a hand-written mirror and how it is kept honest
//
// The wire format is internally tagged on `kind`, in `snake_case`, and is fixed
// by §3.1 — a lane may not change it on either side. Because this file is
// hand-written, the danger is not that it disagrees loudly but that it agrees
// SILENTLY: a variant Rust added and TypeScript never learned about is, to
// `JSON.parse`, just an object, and it flows through the app as `never` until
// something reads a field that is not there.
//
// So the mirror is CHECKED, not asserted. `crates/tine-core/tests/fixtures/
// query-ir/*.json` are the golden wire fixtures the Rust side already
// round-trips; `src/editor/queryIr.test.ts` reads the same files from here and
// requires every variant in them to be constructible and exhaustively handled by
// this module's own visitor. A mirror that quietly ignored an unknown variant is
// the exact defect that test exists to catch.
//
// Spans are UTF-16 code-unit offsets into the ORIGINAL source text, converted
// once at the Rust boundary (`Span::from_byte_range`) precisely because the
// consumer is JavaScript.
