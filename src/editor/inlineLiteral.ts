/** Is a UTF-16 range of an editor buffer literal source text (inline code, verbatim, code containers)?
 *  Every answer is lsdoc's, through the block-region door (I-12): `blockRegions(text).literals`.
 *  Nothing here recognizes a backtick, tilde or fence; the one editor-state policy is a span still
 *  being typed. lsdoc forms no literal from an unclosed opener, so "would the next delimiter, typed
 *  here, close a literal that already contains the range?" is asked of lsdoc too, by parsing the
 *  text with that delimiter spliced in. The candidates are the formats' inline-literal delimiters
 *  (Markdown backtick runs; Org `~` and `=`), tried only when the range is not literal as it stands.
 *  Costs one cached parse, plus up to two more when no literal covers the range; callers invoke it
 *  only once a typography trigger has completed. Before the parser is ready, or for a quarantined
 *  block, the range counts as literal (the edit refuses rather than rewrites). */
