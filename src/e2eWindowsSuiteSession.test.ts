// A journey listed in the Windows suite must be able to open a session there.
//
// GH #240 was re-reported on Windows 0.6.98 with no Windows evidence anywhere,
// so `e2e-selection-actions` was added to the `windows-smoke` suite. Listing it
// was not enough: the journey called `tauriCapabilities(APP)` with no
// `debuggerAddress`, which selects EdgeDriver's *launch* mode — the handshake
// `scripts/e2e-capabilities.mjs` documents as unreliable on hosted WebView2
// runners. Run 33959023127 failed in `openSession` with "session not created:
// DevToolsActivePort file doesn't exist", twice, and never executed a single
// product assertion. The run classified itself `infrastructure`, which is
// correct and is exactly the problem: a registered journey that cannot start
// produces a permanently red advisory job carrying no information about the
// bug it was added to catch.
//
// This is I-16 ("a platform choice covers all five shipped targets") one layer
// out from `cfg`: registering behaviour for a platform whose arm nobody wrote.
// On Linux the wry driver launches the app per WebDriver session; on Windows
// the app must be started first with a fixed remote-debugging port and attached
// to. A journey that serves both starts the app through
// `startWebdriverApplication` and forwards `webviewTarget.debuggerAddress` into
// `tauriCapabilities`. The blessed exemplar is
// `scripts/e2e-page-properties.mjs`; `scripts/e2e-og-parity-references.mjs`
// shows the same shape when the journey also has to restart the app.
//
// selection-actions was itself quarantined from the Windows suite the same day
// after two further failures, so it is no longer one of the entries this guard
// checks. The rule it produced still binds every journey that IS listed, and
// the sentinels above are permanent Windows journeys rather than the one that
// prompted the guard - a sentinel naming the motivating case goes stale exactly
// when that case is withdrawn.
