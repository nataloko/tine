// A fixed sleep before reading persisted bytes is an assertion about a debounce
// nobody observed.
//
// `e2e-pdf-routes` failed 2 runs in 5 on an unchanged binary with "restored PDF
// page was 1, expected 2". It had set page 2, slept a flat 4500ms "for both
// persistence debounces", asserted only that the session file *existed*, then
// killed the app. When the debounce had not fired inside 4.5s the page was
// never written, and the restore was faithfully restoring a file that still
// said page 1. The journey looked like it was testing restore; it was testing
// the machine's mood.
//
// `scripts/e2e-file-poll.mjs` already exports `waitForFileText(file, predicate,
// label)` — bounded polling that tolerates the unlink window of an atomic
// rename. It is the blessed exemplar; `scripts/e2e-page-file-actions.mjs` is a
// short call site to imitate. This ratchet does not demand the 25 pre-existing
// sites be converted — that is a separate, larger piece of work — it only
// requires that the count never rise, so the next journey is written with the
// predicate instead of copying the nearest sleep.
