// GH #543, audit R11-09: `dataRev` moves on every landed save, and while an
// index pass runs each index-backed command waits in the backend until it
// ends. So the question "who reads the index again on every save?" must have
// an owner that keeps one read in flight per source: a `readLane`
// (src/readLane.ts; exemplar src/blockRefCounts.ts), the shared query owner
// `createReadyQueryResource`, the laned `resolveBlockBatched`, or a
// single-flight of its own. Every use of `dataRev` is pinned below with that
// owner. A new use fails here until it is given one.
