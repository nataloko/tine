// Direct Files data-safety audit, finding 9. The save debounce re-arms on every
// keystroke and has no ceiling, so a fluent typing burst is never written to
// disk until the typist pauses. At ~7 chars/second — ordinary prose speed, well
// short of touch-typing — the 400 ms timer is re-armed before it ever fires, and
// a crash or power loss during a long paragraph loses the whole paragraph.
//
// The fix is a MAXIMUM delay measured from the FIRST dirty mark of a burst: the
// debounce still coalesces, but it can no longer be postponed indefinitely.
