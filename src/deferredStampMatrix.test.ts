/**
 * The deferred block-ref stamp, enumerated rather than sampled.
 *
 * GH #254 increment 3 spent verification rounds 4–11 on this one mechanism, and
 * every round had the same shape: a verifier constructed one interleaving, it
 * failed, I added one regression, and the fix opened the next corner. Nine
 * rounds produced nine hand-written tests, each pinning a single point in a
 * space nobody had enumerated. Sampling does not converge on a state machine; it
 * converges on the imagination of whoever is sampling.
 *
 * This enumerates the space instead. What made those rounds hard was never the
 * steady state — it was a mutation landing WHILE the retry's read was in flight,
 * so every case here holds the read open, applies the mutation, and only then
 * lets the read land. The incumbents are the three that actually refuse; a page
 * that does not refuse never defers anything and exercises none of this.
 *
 * The two invariants, stated once:
 *
 *   I1 NO RESURRECTION. If the target file is covered by a tombstone, or the
 *      graph moved on, its bytes must not be installed. Installing them puts a
 *      deleted page back, and `upsertPage` lifts the tombstone as it does so, so
 *      the stamp's own save then recreates the file the user deleted.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ACTUALLY CATCHES. A harness nobody has tested against real defects
 * is decoration, so every historical blocker is reintroduced and replayed
 * (1,360 cases):
 *
 *   round 12b  stamp never made durable ...................... 496 cases fail
 *   round 12   render epoch treated as a graph change ........ 248 cases fail
 *   round 8    name-level tombstone refuses the survivor ...... 92 cases fail
 *   round 13a  block move announces nothing when it ends ...... 32 cases fail
 *   round 10   unknown file refuses at the WAIT boundary ...... 20 cases fail
 *   round 3/5  no retry at all, drop on refusal ............... all cases fail
 *   round 9    request discarded under an unresolved delete ... caught
 *   round 9b   stale tombstone path across a graph switch ..... NOT CAUGHT
 *   round 13b  a backend reopen not announced as a rebind ..... NOT CAUGHT
 *
 * The two misses are structural, not oversights. 9b spans TWO graphs and this
 * models one. 13b is about WHICH CALLER announces a rebind; this covers the
 * resulting state (`rebound`) but calls the notification directly, so it cannot
 * see a caller that stops calling it. Both keep their own necessity-gated tests
 * in instanceReplacement.test.ts, which drive the real entry points.
 *
 * Every correction to this file came from a replay failing, never from reading
 * it. In order: a missing TIMING dimension; a missing RESOLUTION dimension; an
 * oracle asserting activity instead of PROGRESS; an oracle accepting "the page
 * loaded" when the outcome is a DURABLE reference; 112 cases whose release never
 * freed the page; a save-chain entry leaking across cases and silently skipping
 * the progress assertion suite-wide; an oracle that asked `isTombstonedFile`
 * whether a file was deleted — the very predicate round 8's defect corrupts,
 * which took that replay from 18 failures to zero; two whole refusal states
 * (active edit, block move) missing, one of which turned out to announce nothing
 * when it ended; a `blockMovingPage` leak across cases; and a missing banner
 * answer ("Keep mine" is a force-save and frees the page by a different route).
 *
 * The lesson worth keeping: a matrix that is green proves nothing until its
 * failures have been demonstrated. Every one of those defects made it report
 * MORE coverage, not less.
 *
 *   I2 NO SILENT LOSS. The `((uuid))` reference is ALREADY committed — the user
 *      typed it and it is on screen. If the stamp cannot happen now, the request
 *      must still be pending so it can happen later. Dropping it leaves a
 *      reference that resolves this session and dangles after a restart, with
 *      nothing to notice.
