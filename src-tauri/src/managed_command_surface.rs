//! What every Tauri command can do under Tine-managed storage, enumerated.
//!
//! Managed storage shipped with six working commands. Not because anyone
//! decided the other seventy-eight should fail -- because the six were added one
//! at a time, each when a page needed it, and nothing ever asked the command
//! layer what the rest could do. The gap could only surface as a user report,
//! and it did: "Linked References: the backend request failed", on every page.
//!
//! This module is the missing enumeration. Every `#[tauri::command]` in the
//! sources that can reach a graph slot is listed below with the routing it uses,
//! and the tests re-derive that routing from the sources themselves. Adding a
//! command, or changing how one is routed, is a failing diff here rather than a
//! bug report later.
//!
//! It pins *routing*, which is where the defect lived. A command that reaches a
//! `Graph` can still be refused deeper: the read-only view a managed binding
//! hands out fails every graph-text write at `Graph::admit_managed_text_writer`.
//! `import_native_capture` is the standing example -- it is routed to a `Graph`
//! and then refused inside `tine-core`, because appending a capture to today's
//! journal is a graph-text write the oplog owns.
