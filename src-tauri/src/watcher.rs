// incremental reconcile branch pays two full reads + a parse per evented path
// (deliberately no stat shortcut, see `incremental_reconcile`), and the emit
// side sends one `graph-changed` per changed page, which the frontend answers
// with one dataRev bump and up to one `getPage` IPC each. Above the threshold
// both stop scaling per-file: the drained batch escalates to the stat-diff
// full branch (one consistent snapshot; an unchanged file costs one stat), and
// the changed pages are announced as ONE `graph-changed-bulk` event.
