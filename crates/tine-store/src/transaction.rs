//! Guarded multi-file graph writes. A transaction queues steps without disk

//! bytes from undo in a separate `Origin::External` change. A config-file
//! write validates managed directories before disk mutation and reloads
//! effective settings before publication of the final state;
//! undo or a failed apply reconciles them
//! against the final disk file.
//! Transactions are not crash atomic and cannot exclude external processes.
//! Steps may mix page, journal, asset, and metadata files; changed final
