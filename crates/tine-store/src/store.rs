//! Synchronous graph I/O and stable published graph views. `Store::open`
//! lists page and journal files before returning; parsing then runs in the
//! background. `Store::whole_graph` waits for that work and returns a view
//! whose answers remain stable across later changes. `GraphRev` identifies
//! the publication captured by that view. A new view is needed to see edits.
//!
//! One `Store::subscribe` consumer receives later publications in order, without
//! replay. A new subscription ends
//! the previous one with `SubscriptionEnd::Displaced`; the queue has no size bound.
//! Subscribe before acquiring a view, then ignore events at or below its
//! revision to avoid a missed update. Own writes and restore use
//! `Origin::Own`; file observation and explicit refresh use
//! `Origin::External`. `Origin::Own` does not identify a window or operation.
//!
//! `Store::save` and `Transaction::commit` guard against bytes already on
//! disk when they check. They serialize writers through the same Store, but
//! cannot exclude another process replacing a file between check and rename.
//! Changed writes publish before returning. A changed page write or read can
//! also scan metadata for all P page and journal files; the first publication
//! can wait for the graph-wide parse. A loaded view shares untouched page and
//! metadata trees; publishing one edited page patches its blocks and affected
//! names with O(log P) tree updates. Keep the caller's unsaved edits on a
//! refusal. Multi-file commit is not crash atomic.
//!
//! `Store::scan_refresh` compares file modification time and length, so a
//! same-length edit with unchanged timestamp may remain unseen. It waits for
//! the initial parse. Poll mode scans O(P) file metadata and re-hashes
//! `logseq/config.edn` every three seconds; notification mode silently falls
//! back to polling if needed.
//! `Store::close` waits for an in-flight writer and ends observation and the
//! subscription. These calls have no general timeout. Run blocking calls off
//! a UI thread.
