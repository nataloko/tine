//! The watcher's launch baseline (GH #623; storage spec §5.1, §7.6). The
//! load pass stamps every graph file before its one read; the baseline is
//! installed from those observations, and one full stat diff before Ready
//! reconciles whatever changed since. The open-time baseline walk and the
//! second hash pass over every file (`fill_revs`) run only as the fallback
//! when an on-demand build filled the cache instead of the load pass.
//!
//! Unit cost: no file is read here except one whose stamp changed or was
//! racy; one stat per graph file (the launch diff); nothing is written.
