//! The launch checkpoint (storage spec §7.6; ADR 0070): one app-data file per
//! graph holding one whole published generation, written by one background
//! publisher and loaded whole at launch. It is deliberately dumb: a checkpoint
//! that is missing, damaged, of another format, parser, root or config is not
//! used and the launch runs today's initial build; it is never refused,
//! repaired or migrated.
//!
//! File: `MAGIC`, `FORMAT` (u32 LE), header length (u32 LE), postcard
//! [`Header`], then the zstd frame of the postcard [`Body`]. The header pins
//! the parser, the canonical root, the key of the config the generation was
//! built under ([`config_key`]: the settings the build and index path reads,
//! by value, so an edit to any other setting keeps the checkpoint), and the
//! payload's length and SHA-256.
//!
//! Writing: after a dirtying publication, once the graph has been idle for
//! [`IDLE`] and the last write is [`MIN_INTERVAL`] old, or once the change has
//! waited [`MAX_AGE`] (continuous editing cannot starve it); a store that
//! launched cold writes its first checkpoint [`FIRST_IDLE`] after the last
//! publication instead, so the next launch is warm. A lazily built index or
//! memo counts as such a change (Martin, 2026-10-02): every [`LAZY_POLL`] the
//! idle publisher compares the generation's [`LazyMarks`] with what was last
//! written or loaded, so a read-only session that builds one is checkpointed
//! on the same cadence. Capture takes the store writer only to clone `Arc`s and the
//! revision table; serialization, compression and the atomic replace
//! (`atomic_write_with_check`: temp + fsync + rename + directory fsync) run on
//! the `tine-checkpoint` thread. A write killed at any point leaves the
//! previous checkpoint usable.
//!
//! Unit cost: no per-edit write. Per checkpoint, one file of the whole
//! generation (measured in ADR 0070), at most one per `MIN_INTERVAL` (12 an
//! hour) plus the first one after a cold build; zero transport bytes.
