//! GH #623 (Ellis build 4): the fail-before proof for `conflict_inventory`'s
//! per-file reads. A defender-ON Windows open of a file unseen since boot costs
//! ~250x a warm one (subagent-tasks/notes/2026-10-02-windows-defender-ab.md),
//! so the proof is a COUNT of complete file reads, not a timing: once the
//! graph is loaded, an unmarked graph's inventory reads no page file at all,
//! and a marked graph reads exactly its anchor-carrying files.
//!
//! The counters are process-global, so this file holds one test. Fixture files
//! are backdated out of the 2 s racy window (§5.4): a freshly written file is
//! legitimately re-hashed by the watcher's racy follow-up diff about 2 s after
//! open, and under load that follow-up landed inside the counted window
//! (15 or 63 extra hash reads, never a marker read).
//! Invariants: I-25 (unit cost), I-12.
