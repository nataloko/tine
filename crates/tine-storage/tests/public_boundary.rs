//! What an external consumer can actually reach.
//!
//! Every other test in this crate is a unit test compiled *inside* it, so it
//! sees private items and whatever features the surrounding build enabled.
//! That is precisely the wrong vantage point for the question a package split
//! turns into a contract: is the published API self-sufficient from outside,
//! without `test-support`?
//!
//! An integration test is compiled as a separate crate against the built
//! library, so it can only use `pub` paths — which makes this file's *compiling*
//! the assertion. `cargo test -p tine-storage` builds it with default features,
//! so a production path that secretly needs a test seam fails here.
//!
//! This is the fixture `tine-core` would become after extraction, in miniature:
//! when the crate moves out of tree, its consumers see exactly this much.
