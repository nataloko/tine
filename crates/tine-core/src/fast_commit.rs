//! Prototype spine of a fast trusted-local commit.
//!
//! An ordinary edit on a trusted local device does not need consensus, a
//! receipt, or a projection round trip before the user may keep typing. It
//! needs its base to still be current, one durable record of what it is about
//! to do, and the audited graph-text replacement that does it. This module is
//! that spine and nothing else:
//!
//! 1. stale/base validation against the committer's own trusted-local state;
//! 2. one canonical [`tine_storage::LocalJournalFrame`] append plus its single
//!    durability barrier;
//! 3. the existing audited guarded Markdown/Org replacement
//!    ([`Graph::save_page`]);
//! 4. direct return of the already-computed post-edit state.
//!
//! Nothing else is synchronous. SQLite, archive publication, receipt
//! construction, remote validation, and page reload are all absent, and
//! [`ForbiddenCommitWork`] makes that a measured fact rather than a claim.
//!
//! The journal payload is an *existing* encoding. A semantic effect is carried
//! in the canonical [`SemanticEffect`] encoding and a CRDT update is carried in
//! the engine's own exported update bytes. Its discriminator is explicitly
//! prototype-only: these incomplete frames are not the managed-local durable
//! record and cannot be replayed by that bridge.
//!
//! This is a narrowly scoped internal API. It is deliberately not wired into
//! the shipping save route yet: the runtime integration is a later lane's work,
//! and this lane's contract is to prove the spine can meet the ordinary-edit
//! latency budget first.
