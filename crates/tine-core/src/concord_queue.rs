//! Concord (og family 8) — the conflict queue's data model, the VCS-marker
//! scanner and the VCS-marker parser.
//!
//! A **conflict object** is an entirely DERIVED inventory item: nothing here is
//! stored in the graph and nothing is stored outside it either, so the queue
//! survives a restart for free — it is recomputed from what is on disk
//! (`tine_graph_features::conflicts::conflict_inventory`). Two sources feed it:
//!
//! - **conflict copies** left by a sync transport (Syncthing `*.sync-conflict-*`,
//!   Dropbox/Seafile conflicted copies) paired with the winner page they shadow;
//! - **marker-bearing pages** left by a VCS merge (git/Fossil).
//!
//! The model deliberately does NOT assume exactly two sides: a diff3/Fossil
//! marker region carries three (ours, common ancestor, theirs).
//! [`ConflictObject::sides`] is therefore a list, not a pair.
//!
//! ## Marker scanning and parsing
//!
//! [`scan_vcs_conflict_markers`] is THE marker scanner. The store's save
//! refusal (`tine-store` transaction preflight) and [`parse_vcs_marker_sides`]
//! both derive from it, so the code that REFUSES to rewrite a conflicted file
//! and the code that RESOLVES one can never disagree about what a marker is.
//! [`parse_vcs_marker_sides`] turns a marker-bearing file into two or three
//! COMPLETE page texts — the file as each side would have written it — so the
//! ordinary block-level machinery (`sync_diff::diff_docs` / `diff3_docs`,
//! `sync_diff::merge_blocks3`) applies unchanged.
