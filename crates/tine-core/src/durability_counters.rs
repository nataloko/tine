//! Permanent primitive counters for durability barriers.
//!
//! A *durability barrier* is a syscall that forces data or metadata to stable
//! storage: `fsync` of a regular file, `fsync` of a directory, or `syncfs` of a
//! filesystem. Each one costs a real device round trip (~0.3 ms on the audit
//! box's ext4; plausibly hundreds of ms on a slow or network filesystem), so
//! the *number* of barriers an operation performs — not the time any one phase
//! reports — is the cost that scales with the user's hardware.
//!
//! The 2026-08-26 managed-storage cost-model audit found that one accepted
//! single-block managed save executed ~66 barriers against a blind budget of 3,
//! because durability was decided artifact by artifact and nobody ever saw the
//! per-operation sum. Phase timers cannot see multiplicity; counters can. These
//! counters therefore exist to make that sum a **testable budget** rather than
//! an invisible property — see
//! `sync_runtime::tests::managed_save_and_move_stay_within_their_barrier_budget`.
//!
//! ## What is counted, and what is not
//!
//! Every barrier `tine-core` itself initiates is counted, including the two
//! barriers that `tine_storage::publish_immutable_exact*` performs on the
//! caller's behalf: its documented contract is one file `fsync` plus one
//! directory `fsync` per published artifact, and
//! [`note_immutable_publication`] records exactly that pair.
//!
//! Barriers executed *inside* `tine-storage` on its own account — the local
//! journal's append `fsync`s, the SQLite VFS, and SQLite file-set publication —
//! are **not** counted, because they are not reachable from this crate without
//! a `tine-storage` API change. The audit measured that undercount at three
//! barriers per ordinary managed save (two local-journal appends and one SQLite
//! file-set checkpoint) and about four for a cross-page move. Budgets stated in
//! this crate are therefore *core-initiated* barriers, and the tests say so.
//!
//! ## Attribution
//!
//! The process-wide totals ([`snapshot`]) are always maintained; overhead is one
//! relaxed atomic increment on a code path that is about to block on a device
//! round trip, so the counters are always compiled in and no feature flag can
//! drift out of step with production.
//!
//! Tests need per-operation numbers, and `cargo test` runs many graphs
//! concurrently in one process, so process-wide totals cannot be differenced
//! safely. [`BarrierSession`] solves that: a session is a thread-local
//! attribution channel that the managed actor thread **inherits from whichever
//! thread spawned it**, so a test that opens a session before creating its
//! runtime sees that runtime's barriers and no other test's.
