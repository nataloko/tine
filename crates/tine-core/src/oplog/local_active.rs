//! The two `LocalActive` runtime boundaries: first activation and fresh-process
//! reopen.
//!
//! Neither changes anything but device-local enrollment and runtime state. They
//! never write migration or projection bytes into the live graph, never enable
//! migration on ordinary startup, and never wire a watcher.
//!
//! [`LocalActiveAuthority`] is the only value in the new sparse-oplog
//! architecture that admits local mutation, projection, import, or coordinator
//! execution. It has no public constructor, no serialized form, no `Clone`, and
//! no test mint. Exactly two functions can produce one:
//!
//! * [`activate_verified_local`] performs the one-time `VerifiedLocal ->
//!   LocalActive` transition. It requires the retained
//!   [`VerifiedLocalEvidence`], the exact live retained proof set, the retained
//!   runtime components, and a fresh committed-head reopen proving the exact
//!   verification digest, session, binding, and `Unsafe`+`Idle` state.
//! * [`reopen_local_active_authority`] serves a restarted process, which has no
//!   retained evidence and no authority at all. It reconstructs the predecessor
//!   evidence from the durable, validated enrollment chain, revalidates the same
//!   complete proof set and runtime components, and mints an authority only for
//!   the exact committed session (or, from a clean `Safe` handoff, for exactly
//!   one requested new session).
//!
//! Handoff is conservative. Activation always persists `HandoffUnsafe`, so a
//! crash at any cut resumes unsafe. `Safe` may only be persisted after every
//! device-local drain is proved and revalidated; the dependency that this
//! packet cannot prove inside `tine-core` is named exactly rather than assumed.
//!
//! The graph-text watcher event queue is owned by the Tauri watcher, so
//! [`SAFE_HANDOFF_MISSING_DEPENDENCY`] blocks the production `Safe` transition
//! after every core-checkable drain has been proved.
//!
//! # Runtime promotion
//!
//! [`LocalActiveAuthority`] alone still cannot write: an inactive-bootstrap
//! archive is fenced from ordinary runtime opening, so the bootstrap's own
//! engine is read-only. [`PromotedLocalRuntime`] is the boundary that lifts that
//! fence for exactly one durably bound lineage. Promotion is two phase, because
//! the device-local SQLite applier lease is one-per-workspace and the retained
//! inactive bootstrap projection must be released before a promoted one exists:
//!
//! 1. [`seal_local_runtime_promotion`] re-proves the live authority, retained
//!    proof set, inactive accepted authority, bound archive capability and its
//!    persisted canonical resource claim, enrolled endpoint, and bootstrap
//!    SQLite projection, then publishes one immutable exact durable promotion
//!    state. Publication and its readback run on the exact retained archive
//!    capability, never on a re-resolved pathname, and an archive whose
//!    retained capability and enrolled pathname have stopped naming the same
//!    directory is refused before anything is written.
//! 2. [`open_promoted_local_runtime`] (same process) or
//!    [`reopen_promoted_local_runtime`] (restarted process, no retained
//!    evidence at all) opens and completely recovers the writable enrolled
//!    engine, projection-work index, reference/catalog authority, SQLite
//!    projection, and bounded tail, proves the current history is exactly or
//!    insertion-only descended from the exact bootstrap anchor, and only then
//!    mints the token.
//!
//! # Workspace ownership and crash takeover
//!
//! A promoted runtime holds exactly one archive-rooted
//! [`super::sqlite::WorkspaceRuntimeLease`] for its entire writable life, and
//! owns it inseparably from the device-local database it authorized (see
//! [`super::sqlite::LeasedWorkspaceProjection`]), so the database handle and the
//! workspace authority cannot drift apart.
//!
//! The lease is taken before any archive, engine, SQLite, or enrollment state
//! may *become authority* — which is a weaker and more accurate claim than
//! "before any of it is read". A restarted process holds no capability at all,
//! so [`reopen_promoted_local_runtime`] necessarily reads the enrollment chain,
//! takes the device-local enrollment lease, and reads the durable promoted-runtime
//! state before it can even know which archive and workspace to lease. None of
//! those pre-lease reads can authorize anything: the promotion state is
//! published immutably-once and is compared byte-for-byte against the durable
//! file again under the lease by `authorize_promoted_lineage`, the archive
//! identity is re-derived by `authenticate_archive_identity`, and the bootstrap
//! anchor is reread from the chain by [`require_unchanged_bootstrap_anchor`]
//! after the swap. Everything this runtime *writes* happens under the lease.
//!
//! The lock is never released across a bootstrap -> promoted database handoff.
//! That is a property of the construction, not of a test assembly:
//! [`InactiveBootstrapRuntimeSession`] is the crate's inactive-bootstrap open,
//! and its `promote` consumes the session, so there is no way to reach phase two
//! of promotion except on the exact lease the bootstrap database was opened
//! under. What is *not* yet true is that a running Tine binary executes it:
//! nothing in this module is reachable from application startup, a watcher, or
//! Tauri (see the module comments in `oplog/mod.rs`). Tests drive the same
//! construction the activation wiring will call; they do not stand in for it.
//!
//! That lease is also the crash proof. An unclean shutdown leaves
//! `HandoffUnsafe { old session }` committed, and
//! [`take_over_promoted_local_runtime`] is the only boundary that may replace it
//! with `HandoffUnsafe { new session }`. It may do so only while it owns the
//! workspace lease — an `EnrollmentLease` is device-local app data, so a process
//! under another XDG, HOME, or Flatpak root would not contend for it at all —
//! and only after it has recovered and authenticated the entire runtime the
//! crashed process left behind. The replacement is then an exact
//! compare-and-swap from the authenticated old head and old unsafe session, so
//! two racing newcomers cannot both win. It never mints `Safe`. Automatic
//! external import remains fenced until the actor-owned exact feed completes
//! and revalidates one full recovery catch-up, or until a later clean `Safe`
//! handoff is adopted.
//!
//! ## Workspace lease identity
//!
//! Holding the lock is not by itself proof of ownership, because the lock file
//! lives inside the replicated archive. A provider or user action that replaces
//! `<archive>/.tine-runtime/sqlite-workspaces/<workspace>/sqlite-applier.lock`
//! — a receive-only revert, a folder reset/re-add, a delete-then-restore, a
//! `.stversions` restore, `rm -rf .tine-runtime` — unlinks the locked file and
//! puts a new one at the same name. The old holder keeps a lock nobody can
//! reach by name; a newcomer opening the name locks the new file and succeeds.
//!
//! [`super::sqlite::WorkspaceRuntimeLease`] therefore binds itself to one
//! platform-native stable file identity at acquisition and revalidates it
//! while held. This is the exact, and deliberately smallest, set of places that
//! revalidation happens; every one of them is a boundary this runtime already
//! re-derives archive, enrollment, or head authority at:
//!
//! 1. **Acquisition.** `WorkspaceRuntimeLease::acquire` compares the locked
//!    handle against a fresh no-follow resolution of the exact pathname, with a
//!    small bounded number of explicit retries, then fails closed as
//!    `LeaseContended`.
//! 2. **Every database opened under the lease.** `SqliteApplierSlot::authorize`,
//!    reached from `DatabaseApplierLease::acquire` — so the inactive bootstrap
//!    open, its retry [`InactiveBootstrapRuntimeSession::reopen_under`], and the
//!    promoted open inside [`mint_promoted_runtime`] all revalidate.
//! 3. **Every use of the lease as a proof.**
//!    `WorkspaceRuntimeProof::authorize_archive`, which is what
//!    [`RetainedWorkspaceLease::into_lease`] consumes at the bootstrap ->
//!    promoted handover and what
//!    `RetainedEnrollmentSession::authenticate_unsafe_predecessor` consumes
//!    before the crash-takeover compare-and-swap.
//! 4. **Every archive-identity reread.** [`PromotedLocalRuntime::prove_binding`]
//!    revalidates exactly when it rereads the archive's canonical resource claim
//!    and control-directory identity — that is, at every
//!    [`BindingProofDepth::Boundary`] proof (the promoted-open/recovery final
//!    proof) and at every admission whose enrollment binding generation moved.
//! 5. **Every SQLite advance.** [`PromotedRuntimeSession::drain_projection`].
//! 6. **The promoted `Safe` handoff**, before the drain proof is believed.
//!
//! 7. **Every handout of the mutable SQLite/tail parts.**
//!    [`PromotedRuntimeSession::parts`], which is the shape both the
//!    operational coordinator and the reconciliation session take.
//! 8. **Every authority-changing coordinator boundary**: immutable publication,
//!    every bounded accepted-history archive-stage slice, tail admission, the
//!    SQLite drain, and each manifested Markdown projection step, through
//!    [`LocalRuntimeAdmission::reprove_workspace_authority`].
//!
//! It deliberately does **not** run in the per-mutation admission fast path.
//! Lease identity is a stable session fact of exactly the same class as the
//! archive control-directory identity, and it is carried under the identical
//! rule: [`ArchiveAuthentication::Carried`] carries it, any observed
//! enrollment-head change escalates to [`ArchiveAuthentication::Reread`] and
//! re-derives it. So an unchanged-head admission issues no filesystem call for
//! it, which `bounded_admission`'s zero-cost table asserts at 1, 1,000, and
//! 10,000 admissions.
//!
//! ## Revocation is terminal, and deliberately not self-healing
//!
//! The first failed revalidation at *any* of those boundaries latches
//! [`RuntimeRevocation`] on the runtime, one way and forever. Every later
//! admission, mutation window, projection drain, mutable-part handout, window
//! authorization, coordinator phase proof, and `Safe` handoff then refuses
//! from the latch, without reusing a proof this runtime carried from before the
//! replacement — which is exactly the hole a carried
//! [`ArchiveAuthentication::Carried`] admission would otherwise leave open
//! after a failed boundary proof.
//!
//! It is deliberately not recoverable in place. A replaced lease pathname means
//! another process may legitimately own the archive now, so "recovering" would
//! mean two appliers. Recovery is a fresh reopen or crash takeover, which
//! contends for the lease honestly through
//! [`reopen_promoted_local_runtime`]/[`take_over_promoted_local_runtime`].
//!
//! The honest residual: one batch authored inside an already-open mutation
//! window can still be *published* to the archive after a replacement, because
//! immutable content-addressed publication is not lease-gated at all (honest
//! peers on other devices publish into the same archive by design). The
//! coordinator's own publication boundary reproves first, so the *coordinator*
//! cannot publish after a replacement; a hand-rolled caller holding a live
//! window still can. What the lease gates — opening a device-local database,
//! advancing SQLite, admitting to the tail, writing manifested Markdown,
//! swapping a crash-takeover handoff record, and publishing `Safe` — all fail
//! closed first.
//!
//! ## Lock order, and why it is safe to invert it without blocking
//!
//! The global order is enrollment lease, then archive-rooted workspace lease.
//! [`reopen_promoted_local_runtime`] and [`take_over_promoted_local_runtime`]
//! take it in that order. The bootstrap path deliberately **inverts** it:
//! [`InactiveBootstrapRuntimeSession::open`] takes the workspace lease first and
//! [`InactiveBootstrapRuntimeSession::promote`] takes the enrollment lease
//! afterwards, because the workspace lease has to be continuously held across
//! the database handoff.
//!
//! That inversion cannot deadlock for exactly one reason: **both acquisitions
//! are non-blocking.** `fs2::try_lock_exclusive` under `WorkspaceRuntimeLease`
//! and under `EnrollmentLease` both return immediately, and contention becomes
//! an immediate refusal rather than a wait. The identity retry added above is
//! bounded and explicit for the same reason, and it releases the lock it took
//! before retrying.
//!
//! This is a standing contract for the activation, watcher, and Tauri phases:
//! **no future code may block, spin, or retry unboundedly while holding either
//! lease and waiting for the other.** If a retry is ever genuinely needed, bound
//! it explicitly and release the already-held lease first.
//!
//! The bootstrap stays an immutable historical anchor. Ordinary local batches
//! extend it by carrying the identical bootstrap aggregate binding forward, so
//! the promoted history is one homogeneous bootstrap-anchored lineage that the
//! durable promotion state explicitly authorizes — never a silently
//! reinterpreted inactive root and never mixed record bindings. Ancestry is
//! proved by the store-minted [`super::object_store::AuthenticatedEngineHistoryTransition`],
//! never by raw generation or acceptance sequence.
//!
//! # The retained-resume accelerator
//!
//! A promoted open may reuse the run-local engine state a previous session left
//! behind instead of replaying the whole authenticated history. The entire
//! lifecycle lives inside this module's sealed boundaries, and every step is
//! dominated by the one archive-rooted workspace lease this runtime holds:
//!
//! 1. **Open.** [`mint_promoted_runtime`] takes the lease, authenticates the
//!    archive, then — before anything is adopted — reproves the lease, asks the
//!    durable history store for a retention plan, and reads at most one
//!    published candidate through a duplicate of the *retained* archive
//!    capability. The enrollment evidence that read is admitted against is
//!    derived here from the retained authenticated session
//!    ([`resume_enrollment_admission`]), never supplied by a caller.
//! 2. **Selection.** Only a valid `ResumeAdoptionCandidate::Available` is
//!    offered to the engine. Never published, proof denied by residue or
//!    surplus, torn, stale, conflicted, binding-refused, still-leased — every
//!    other shape opens exactly as a fresh full replay would, without failing
//!    startup and without changing one candidate byte. An `Ephemeral` retention
//!    plan means the archive cannot currently prove a retained run collectable,
//!    so this open takes a disposable run and adds nothing to the population.
//! 3. **Unsafe publication.**
//!    [`PromotedLocalRuntime::publish_quiescent_resume_point`] and the narrower
//!    post-open/pre-first-mutation operation mint exact Unsafe-bound evidence.
//!    They run the same device-local drain proof as the Safe transaction and
//!    reprove the lease immediately before the snapshot.
//! 4. **Safe transaction.** [`PromotedLocalRuntime::quiesce_and_mark_safe`]
//!    holds graph and watcher barriers through drain proof, clear-before-Safe,
//!    durable Safe commit/readback, and report-only Safe-bound publication.
//! 5. **Reclamation.** Only the sealed `PublishedResumePoint` a successful
//!    publication mints authorizes deletion, and the pass reproves the lease
//!    once more first. This is the only boundary in this module that can delete
//!    archive bytes. Packed Patricia scanning is enabled only for a caller's
//!    explicit quiescent publication or after durable Safe; the automatic
//!    post-open publication never scans those directories.
//!
//! The whole thing is an accelerator, so it has no `Err` reaching a caller's
//! control flow: [`ResumePublicationStatus`] and [`RuntimeResumeOpenStatus`] are
//! typed, diagnosable status. A full replay is always available and always
//! correct, and a publication or maintenance failure must never block an
//! otherwise valid `Unsafe -> Safe` handoff.
//!
//! Neither status vends a scan, a reachability proof, a record, or any deletion
//! surface, and neither is read by ordinary admission: the accelerator is
//! absent from successful keystroke, authoring, and acceptance paths. The one
//! exceptional boundary is a deferred catalog authentication refusal, which
//! refuses that mutation, fully replays immutable history into a fresh run,
//! and publishes its replacement so the damaged run cannot be re-adopted.
//!
//! A proven pathname/file-identity replacement latches a terminal
//! [`RuntimeRevocation`]; inability to perform an identity check refuses only
//! that operation and remains retryable. Typed refusals distinguish the two,
//! and [`PromotedLocalRuntime::workspace_authority_revocation`] gives a future
//! startup/UI facade the terminal boundary and cause needed to reopen/take over
//! automatically. Core deliberately does not implement that facade.
//!
//! Every new-architecture mutation, projection, import, coordinator, and
//! reconciliation path requires a [`LocalRuntimeAdmission`] whose only
//! production source is [`PromotedRuntimeAdmission::admission`], which is itself
//! derived from *both* a live [`LocalActiveAuthority`] and the exact
//! [`PromotedLocalRuntime`].
