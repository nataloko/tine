//!
//! `LocalActiveAuthority` is the only value that admits managed mutation,
//! projection, import, or coordinator execution. It has no public constructor,

//! and reopen boundaries in this module.
//!
//! [`CleanLocalRuntime`] owns the archive-rooted workspace lease together with

//! is why that cannot happen again here.)
//!
//! Retained resume state is only an accelerator: refusal or damage falls back to
