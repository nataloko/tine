//! The core-owned graph-text watcher event queue, its drain epochs, and the
//! RAII quiesce guard that a later `Safe` handoff needs.
//!
//! [`super::local_active::SAFE_HANDOFF_MISSING_DEPENDENCY`] names the one
//! device-local drain `tine-core` could not observe: the watcher event queue was
//! owned by the Tauri watcher, so a production `LocalActive -> Safe` transition
//! had to fail closed. This module moves that queue into the core so the drain
//! becomes provable here. It deliberately stops one step short of the handoff:
//! nothing in `local_active`, enrollment, startup, or Tauri is wired to it yet.
//!
//! What the primitive owns, and nothing else:
//!
//! * **Binding.** A queue is created for exactly one enrolled
//!   [`ProjectionStorageBinding`] (endpoint identity plus receipt-store
//!   identity). Every intake, drain, and quiesce call presents the binding it
//!   believes it is talking to, and a substituted binding is refused before any
//!   state moves. Epochs additionally carry a process-unique queue identity, so
//!   a second queue's acknowledgement can never settle this queue's work.
//! * **Bounded intake.** Exact [`ManagedPath`] hints are retained while they fit
//!   the configured count and byte limits. An observation batch is consumed
//!   lazily against those limits, so a watcher that reports a huge batch never
//!   materializes it here: the moment exact retention would exceed the bound,
//!   the batch collapses into one uncertain full-scan requirement and the rest
//!   of the batch stops being polled because a full scan already subsumes it.
//!   Every notify error, unknown path, or rescan request collapses the batch
//!   the same way. Work is never dropped; it is only ever made coarser.
//! * **Epochs.** One monotonic sequence counts intake, allocated with a checked
//!   add so an epoch is never reused. A drain is stamped with the sequence it
//!   actually covers, and an acknowledgement is accepted only for the exact
//!   in-flight work epoch. Anything enqueued during the drain lands past that
//!   epoch, so acknowledging the drain cannot claim it. If the sequence or the
//!   process-wide queue identity runs out, the queue closes and construction
//!   fails rather than aliasing unrelated work.
//! * **Quiesce.** [`WatcherQueueOwner::begin_quiesce`] bars intake and proves
//!   the queue empty, un-drained, and fully acknowledged under one lock. The
//!   returned guard defers intake; [`WatcherQuiesceGuard::commit_handoff`] then
//!   raises a stronger exclusive bar, waits for every already-started intake to
//!   land, re-proves the quiesce, and holds that bar across the caller's durable
//!   `Safe` commit. A failed proof, a failed commit, or a plain drop leaves the
//!   queue live with every epoch and every retained event intact.
//!
//! The queue has no filesystem authority, holds no [`crate::model::Graph`], and
//! writes no enrollment or projection state. Its only output is a
//! [`ReconciliationTrigger`], which the existing
//! [`super::reconciliation_scan::ReconciliationScheduler`] already knows how to
//! coalesce; reconciliation semantics are not restated here.
//!
//! The threat model is the campaign's: honest single-user watcher/process races
//! and crashes, not a hostile peer. A crash loses only in-memory intake, and the
//! durable handoff stays `Unsafe` in exactly that case, so the next process
//! full-scans.
