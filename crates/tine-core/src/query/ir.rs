//! The ONE query intermediate representation (SPEC §3, I-12).
//!
//! A query is an **anchored filter**: one row type ([`Anchor`]), a boolean tree
//! ([`Filter`]), and leaves that are either a comparison on the anchor row's own
//! attributes or a quantifier over ONE of its relations. Three things produce it
//! (the legacy OG `{{query}}` parser, the TQL parser, the recognised
//! `#+BEGIN_QUERY` subset) and the walk, the SQL lowering, the builder and cache
//! invalidation all consume this one value — `Pred`, the TypeScript `Clause`
//! union and the datalog subset collapsed onto it.
//!
//! **The wire format is fixed by SPEC §3.1 and is not a lane's choice.** Every
//! enum is internally tagged on `kind` with `snake_case` names and every struct
//! field is `snake_case`, because the frontend mirror in
//! `src/editor/queryIr.ts` is hand-written against it and pinned by the
//! golden fixtures in `crates/tine-core/tests/fixtures/query-ir/` (read from
//! both sides).
//!
//! [`Span`] offsets are **UTF-16 code units** into the original source text: the
//! consumer is JavaScript, so the conversion from the byte offsets the parsers
//! compute happens once, here at the boundary ([`Span::from_byte_range`]).
