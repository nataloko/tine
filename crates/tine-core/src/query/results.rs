//! The ONE database-backed result constructor, for BOTH backends (R3).
//!
//! A ready query's public answer is built here, from ONE owned read snapshot of
//! the projection: no page document is loaded, no source text is read, and no
//! parsed cache is consulted. That is the whole point of the packet — a page
//! with several thousand blocks and one match must cost one descriptor row and
//! one payload row, not a document parse.
//!
//! **What this module is, and is not.**
//!
//! * SELECTION is the compiler's statement ([`crate::query::sql::lower_query`]),
//!   passed in verbatim. This module wraps it once
//!   ([`crate::query::sql::descriptor_view_statement`]) to add ordering and the
//!   result metadata; it never re-lowers, never re-applies §5.3's result-set
//!   rule (the statement already did), and never edits the predicate.
//! * Main-result ORDERING and semantic sampling precede admission in SQL.
//!   Statistics fold that complete sample in the same snapshot; only admitted
//!   descriptors enter payload hydration. Located export and probe consumers
//!   retain their existing construction-order entry point and bounds.
//! * The BUDGET is [`ConstructionBudget`] itself, walked with the same four
//!   rules `collect_sql_matched_blocks` uses, in the same order. `total` and
//!   `exceeded` are the budget's, not a second policy.
//! * The PAYLOAD is read only for ADMITTED ids, in batches of
//!   [`PAYLOAD_BATCH`], three bound statements per batch — never one statement
//!   per block, never a tags×properties join, never `SELECT *`.
//!
//! **A damaged read FAILS (D-3).** Every join in the descriptor read is LEFT
//! and every batch is validated for exact coverage, ownership and counts, so a
//! missing metadata row, a stale count or a page id that does not match cannot
//! turn into a shorter answer. The projection is a disposable cache; the
//! recovery for damage is a rebuild, which the caller schedules on
//! [`ResultReadError::Corrupt`]. It is never a silently smaller result set.
//!
//! **No live state, no locks.** `read_results` takes a snapshot and plain
//! inputs. It never calls into `Graph`, never holds a graph or actor lock, and
//! never caches anything. The identity policy and the recency producer are
//! CAPTURED by the caller and passed in, so a mutable live lookup cannot slip
//! into the middle of an answer.
