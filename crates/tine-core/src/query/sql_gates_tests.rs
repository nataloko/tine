//! The two gates SPEC §5 makes this wave's acceptance bar, and the harness both
//! of them run on.
//!
//! * **`walk == SQL`, always.** The lowering and the walk answer the same
//!   question over the same graph, so a difference is a failure of this wave and
//!   never a documented divergence (I-19, I-12). The comparison is at the
//!   PRODUCT level — the block ids a query returns, `tree/filter-top-level-blocks`
//!   included — because that is what a user sees.
//! * **The plan gate (§5.7).** A positively bounded query must reach its anchor
//!   table by `SEARCH`, never `SCAN`, and every bounded relation subquery must
//!   show an index. It runs through `tine-storage`'s `explain_query_plan`
//!   accessor, so it is an ordinary repository test rather than a scratch
//!   harness.
//!
//! **Assert the semantics, not the string.** `blocks` is a rowid table with a
//! BLOB primary key, so SQLite spells the anchor probe `SEARCH b USING
//! [COVERING] INDEX sqlite_autoindex_blocks_1 (block_id=?)` and NEVER `SEARCH b
//! USING PRIMARY KEY` — that spelling is for INTEGER-PK and `WITHOUT ROWID`
//! tables. Same access path, different text.
//!
//! The fast corpus below is the permanent one. `~/research/logseq-anonymized` is
//! an acceptance gate rather than an optional extra (AGENTS §4 tier 2), reached
//! through the `#[ignore]`d twins; when the real graph disagrees with the fast
//! corpus that is a CORPUS DEFECT, and the fix is to extract the minimal shape
//! into the fixture below. No corpus content is read into an assertion message,
//! a receipt or any other artifact — only aggregate counts and plan strings.
