//! RET3: **database-owned export subtree construction**, over the caller's own
//! snapshot.
//!
//! Copy / Export answers a query macro with the SUBTREE under each selected
//! result, not just the matched row. Today that is done by re-scanning parsed
//! source documents: `hydrate_selected_export_queries` walks every candidate
//! page looking for a block whose `uuid` — or whose `id::` property — equals a
//! selected result's PUBLIC id. Two things are wrong with that as a database
//! answer, and this module exists to fix both.
//!
//! * **A public id is not an identity.** Two physical blocks may expose the
//!   same public id (an `id::` property copied between pages) and two physical
//!   pages may share a display name. The source re-scan resolves such a pair by
//!   whichever page it happened to reach first. Here, selection attaches a
//!   [`ResultLocator`] — physical page id and physical block id — at
//!   admission, while the collector still owns those facts, and hydration reads
//!   exactly that block on exactly that snapshot.
//! * **A subtree is not a page.** Loading a whole document to answer "the four
//!   blocks under this one" is the same N+1 R3 removed from result reads. Here
//!   the subtree is a contiguous run of `blocks.preorder` inside
//!   one page, read in batches of [`TOPOLOGY_BATCH`], and OUTPUT PAYLOAD is
//!   read only for the nodes the budget actually admitted.
//!
//! **What this module does not do.** It opens no connection, acquires no job,
//! actor or graph lock, reads no source document, and performs no recovery or
//! retry. It receives the SAME `&mut` snapshot the selection ran on, plus the
//! identity policy the caller captured beside it. Capacity, snapshot
//! acquisition, the public command adapters, the final
//! cancellation check and releasing the transactions all stay with the caller.
//! [`ResultReadError`] is the shared failure vocabulary.
//!
//! **The budget is the oracle's, transcribed.**
//! [`crate::query::select_export_queries_over`] owns the macro cap and the
//! global root pool for BOTH routes. The node/byte budget below is
//! `block_to_bounded_dto`'s exact rule, and it is deliberately NOT a global
//! preorder prefix: when a child does not fit, that parent's remaining child
//! loop stops and the parent is still emitted, so an ANCESTOR's later sibling
//! can still fit. It runs on an explicit stack rather than by recursion, so a
//! deep but perfectly valid tree cannot overflow the thread stack.
