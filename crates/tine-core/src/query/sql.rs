//! The ONE IR → SQL lowering (SPEC §5.1–§5.7).
//!
//! **What this module is.** It turns a [`Query`] — the same value the walk
//! evaluates in [`crate::query::eval`] — into one statement plus its bound
//! parameters, to be run through `tine-storage`'s read-only projection
//! statement seam (`PhysicalProjectionQueryReader`, D-15). It is a compiler and
//! nothing else: it opens no database, holds no connection, and has no opinion
//! about which backend runs the statement.
//!
//! **Transcription (D-9, D-14).** Each function below names the upstream
//! function it transcribes, read from the upstream source rather than inferred
//! from behaviour:
//!
//! | Tine function | Upstream source |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`Compiler::filter`] | `hasura/ndc-postgres` `crates/query-engine/translation/src/translation/query/filtering.rs::translate_expression_with_joins` — the `And`/`Or`/`Not` skeleton folded over already-translated operand expressions, with an empty `In` list short-circuited to a false constant. |
//! | [`Compiler::quantified`] | `gorilla-co/odata-query` `odata_query/django/django_q.py::visit_CollectionLambda` — `Any` is the subquery, `All` is the subquery over the NEGATED predicate with the whole thing negated (its own comment: "If ALL items in the collection must match, we invert the condition and use NOT EXISTS()"). The `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS` pair is spelled here as §5.1's fixed `IN (subquery)` / `NOT IN (subquery)`, which is the same predicate over an owner column that is never NULL. |
//! | [`Compiler::relation_subquery`]'s `invert` flag | `prisma-engines` `query-compiler/query-builders/sql-query-builder/src/filter/visitor.rs` — its `reverse: bool` field and `invert_reverse` helper, a negation carried INTO the nested visit rather than wrapped around its result. |
//! | [`Compiler::exists_subquery`] | `hasura/ndc-postgres` `filtering.rs::translate_exists_in_collection` — one `SELECT <owner> FROM <relation> WHERE <join condition> AND <predicate>` per quantifier, built in the relation's own row scope. |
//!
//! **The three rules a plausible implementation gets wrong** (SPEC §5.1, §5.2,
//! §5.7), each of which has a guard test at the bottom of this file:
//!
//! 1. **One `IN (subquery)` per relational quantifier, never decomposed.**
//!    [`Compiler::quantified`] is the only producer of a relation predicate, and
//!    it always emits ONE subquery carrying the whole conjunction. Decomposing
//!    `props any(key='status' ∧ value='open')` and `props any(key='priority' ∧
//!    value='done')` into four independent probes is what makes a block match
//!    because *some* row satisfies each conjunct separately.
//! 2. **Nothing is NULL.** Every expression this module produces is two-valued.
//!    Subqueries over a nullable owner column (today only
//!    `blocks.parent_block_id`) carry `IS NOT NULL`, and every comparison on a
//!    nullable column is spelled `(<col> IS NOT NULL AND <cmp>)` — SQL's
//!    three-valued logic does not agree with §3.4's classical `not`, and the
//!    difference only shows up on sparse real data. §5.2 writes that guard as
//!    `COALESCE(<cmp>, 0)`; the two are the same two-valued function, and the
//!    `IS NOT NULL AND` spelling is the only one of them that is SARGABLE —
//!    measured, `COALESCE(bp.scheduled_day >= ?, 0)` turns
//!    `block_planning_scheduled_day_idx` from a range SEARCH into a covering
//!    SCAN, which is §5.7's own failure. Rules 2 and 7 both hold in this
//!    spelling and cannot both hold in the other.
//! 3. **No table scan where a positive index exists.**
//!    [`positively_bounded`] implements §5.7's table, which is **exhaustive**: a
//!    leaf/operator pair absent from it is unbounded.
//!
//! **§5.11's driver rule, and why rule 1 is about DECOMPOSITION and not about
//! the word `IN`.** One subquery per quantifier is a correctness rule; whether
//! that subquery is spelled as a list or as a correlated probe is a PLAN choice,
//! and [`RelationRule`] is where it is made. SQLite materialises an uncorrelated
//! `IN (SELECT …)` in full before probing it, so a conjunction of relation
//! leaves used to cost the SUM of the facet slices it mentioned even when its
//! answer was three rows: `(and [[Page]] (not (task DONE)))` enumerated every
//! DONE task in the graph. Under [`RELATION_RULE`] exactly one bounded root
//! conjunct keeps the list spelling and drives the anchor, and every other root
//! conjunct probes its facet by key, once per candidate. Both spellings are
//! checked against the walk by
//! `the_two_relation_spellings_answer_identically`, because the swap is only
//! legitimate while every key selected here is `NOT NULL`.
//!
//! **`walk == SQL` is the contract (I-19, I-12).** Every comparison below is
//! written against the walk's own code in [`crate::query::eval`], and the
//! normalization applied to a literal is the SAME function the projection
//! producer applied to the column (`refs::page_key` for `pages.name_key` and
//! `tags.tag_key`, `refs::normalize` for `block_path_refs.normalized_name`,
//! `doc::property_key_norm` for `normalized_name`, `atom::atom_key` for
//! `atom_key`, `search_query::canonical_fold` for `query_visible_folded`) —
//! never a second normalizer that agrees by inspection.
//!
//! **`content match` (§5.10).** The compiler consumes the SAME parsed
//! [`search_query::Matcher`] the walk consumes — [`crate::query::compiled::CompiledLeaves`],
//! keyed by [`Filter::match_sources`] — and never re-parses the payload
//! (I-12, D-14). Each retained OR arm becomes an `AND` of `instr` predicates on
//! `blocks.query_visible_folded`, and, when the FTS index is READY, gains a
//! trigram CANDIDATE BOUND that may only ever OVER-approximate: the exact
//! `instr` predicates stay as the final conditions on every path, so a bound
//! that admitted too many rows costs time and a bound that excluded one would
//! be a correctness bug. `foobar` is therefore found by `foo`, by `oob` AND by
//! `oo` — the last one through no bound at all, because word-token FTS cannot
//! answer it.
//!
//! **This compiler declines nothing.** It is total by TYPE — [`lower_query`]
//! returns a [`SqlQuery`] and there is no "unsupported" answer to return — which
//! is the enforceable form of §5.9's rule that a ready projection answers every
//! shape the IR can express. The two families that used to decline are lowered
//! here:
//!
//! * **A valid regex** — `content regexp <pattern>` and the whole-query
//!   `/pattern/` form of `content match`. §4.3.2's fixed SQL predicate is
//!   `tine_query_regex(<id>, <exact visible text>)`, a scalar function
//!   `tine-storage` registers on the read-only connection over a
//!   caller-owned table of compiled regexes ([`QueryRegexProgram`]). The IDs are
//!   BOUND VALUES and the regexes are cheap clones of the SAME
//!   [`CompiledLeaves`] values the walk consumes — never a second compile, a
//!   second grammar or an interpolated pattern (I-12, D-14, I-22). An INVALID
//!   pattern still needs no engine: it is a retained leaf that matches false
//!   (§4.3.2), so it lowers to the constant `0`.
//! * **A `refs` leaf nested inside a `children` predicate.** The walk evaluates
//!   it under the ANCHOR's ancestor multiset, carried through every `children`
//!   quantifier unchanged — see [`Compiler::refs`] for the three stored facts
//!   that reconstruct exactly that set.
