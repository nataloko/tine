//! The B2 acceptance gate: every crash cut of a Direct cross-page move
//! converges, and neither terminal state changes a byte the move did not own.
//!
//! **What "the crash matrix" means here.** A Direct cross-page move's durable
//! steps are exactly the ones `direct_move_durable_steps` names — commit the
//! record, write the destination, write each source, retire the record — and the
//! only thing a crash can do is stop the sequence after some step k. So instead
//! of killing a process and hoping to hit an interesting moment, these tests
//! EXECUTE the production functions in the production order, stop after each k
//! in turn, and run the real `recover_all` on the resulting disk. Every reachable
//! disk state is covered by construction rather than by sampling. The frontend's
//! side of the same claim — that `src/store.ts` really emits that order — is
//! pinned by `src/directMoveOrder.test.ts`.
