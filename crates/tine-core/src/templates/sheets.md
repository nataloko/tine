- # Sheets
	- Sheets turn ordinary outline branches into 2-D views — tables, boards, and grids. The same file still opens in Logseq as nested bullets with harmless `tine.*` properties, in Markdown and Org alike.
	- This page starts with the easiest path — viewing bullets you already have — and adds fields, formulas, and query-backed views after.
- ## Start from bullets you already have
	- Sheets never move your data: rows are child bullets, columns are their properties, cards are child bullets or blocks a query finds. Nothing is converted or copied.
	- Right-click a parent bullet and choose **Show children as → Grid** or **Table** — or type `/Grid`, `/Table`, or `/Board` on that block. To view blocks a query finds instead, type `/Query`, then run `/Table` or `/Board` on the query block.
	- What Tine writes: plain block properties such as `tine.view:: table` on the view-owning block. Editing a sheet cell writes back into the underlying bullet, so the outline and the sheet always agree.
- ## Task table
  tine.view:: table
  tine.col-aggregates:: prop:estimate=sum
	- TODO [#A] Draft the sheet docs #sheets-demo

- ### Create one yourself — table
	- 1. On a block, type `/Table` and pick **Table** (or right-click an existing outline and choose **Show children as → Table**).
	- 2. Use the ghost **+ Add row** and **+ Add column** buttons to build it out. Each row is a child bullet; each column is a property such as `owner::` or `estimate::`, edited right in the cells.
	- 3. Right-click a children-backed column header or double-click its name to rename the field and its dependent filter, group, aggregate, and formula references together. Ambiguous or colliding names are refused.
	- 4. Drag the right edge of a column header to set its width; double-click that edge to reset the one column. Widths are remembered per field, so they survive a reload and follow the field if you reorder columns. A table wider than the pane scrolls sideways instead of crushing its text.
	- 5. Press **Tab** after editing a cell to commit its value and move to the next cell.
	- 6. What you should see: each child bullet becomes a row, and properties become editable table columns.
	- 7. Under the hood: the block carries `tine.view:: table` (with optional `tine.fields::` to type columns and `tine.col-aggregates:: prop:estimate=sum` to total a numeric column in the footer). The ghost buttons write these for you.
- ## Typed reading list
  tine.view:: table
  tine.fields:: status=enum:todo,reading,done;rating=number;done=checkbox;owner=ref
  tine.formula.effort:: rating * 2
	- Bases study
	  status:: reading
	  rating:: 5
	  done:: false
	  owner:: [[Martin]]
	- CSV import notes
	  status:: todo
	  rating:: 3
	  done:: false
	  owner:: [[Codex]]
- ### Create one yourself — formula
	- 1. Start with a table that has a numeric or enum field, for example `rating=number`.
	- 2. Right-click a column header and choose **Add formula…**, then build the value from the visual faces (or the `</> raw` box).
	- 3. What you should see: a read-only computed column — like `effort` above, which multiplies each row's `rating` by 2 — whose values evaluate live and are not written onto the rows.
	- 4. For the full walkthrough — the value picker, IF / THEN / ELSE, transforms, and when to reach for `</> raw` — see [[Features/Formulas]].
- ## Task board
	- {{query (and (task TODO DOING DONE) #sheets-demo)}}
	  tine.view:: board
	  tine.group-by:: state
- ### Create one yourself — query
	- 1. Type `/Query` and create a query for the blocks you want, such as tasks tagged `#sheets-demo`.
	- 2. Keep the query in one block, then run `/Table` or `/Board` on that same block to view the results.
	- 3. For a board, pick the column axis with the **Group by** dropdown (described in the board steps below).
	- 4. What you should see: query results rendered as a live sheet view — the same demo tasks as in the table above — without copying the source blocks.
- ### Create one yourself — board
	- 1. On a block, type `/Board` and pick **Board** (`/Kanban` finds it too).
	- 2. Choose the column axis with the **Group by** dropdown in the board header, or right-click and use **Group by →** to pick State, Tags, Priority, or any field.
	- 3. Add child bullets, or run `/Board` on a query block to board over query results.
	- 4. Drag a card between columns (or press **Ctrl+←/→**) and the grouping field changes on the source block.
	- 5. What you should see: cards group into columns while staying normal outline blocks underneath. Group by **Tags** and a card with several tags appears in each matching column — like the topic board below.
	- 6. Under the hood: the dropdown just writes `tine.view:: board` and `tine.group-by:: state` (or your chosen axis) for you.
- ## Topic board

- ### Create one yourself — grid
	- 1. On an empty block, type `/Grid` and pick **Grid**. Tine seeds one editable cell — just start typing.
	- 2. Grow it by its **edges**: hover the grid and click the **`+`** on the right edge for a new column, or the **`+`** on the bottom edge for a new row. Drag row or cell bullets to reshape it; the grid follows the tree.
	- 3. What you should see: a live grid whose cells are still ordinary Logseq bullets — including ragged rows and, above, a whole grid nested in one cell.
	- 4. Under the hood: the block just carries `tine.view:: grid` (plus optional `tine.header:: true` for a label row and `tine.col-widths::`). You never have to type those by hand.
- ## Honest limits
	- Formula columns are derived: computed live, never written onto the rows.
	- Board cards move between columns, but not within one. `page` columns are read-only.
	- A board grouped by a formula axis is read-only — moving a card cannot rewrite a computed value.
