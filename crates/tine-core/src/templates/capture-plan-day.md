- # Capture and plan your day
  - The shortest path: open **Journals** in the sidebar and start typing. Everything below adds one tool at a time — a task marker, a priority, a date — and ends with the two things that keep a plan current: the Agenda and carry-over.
- ## Describe your day in bullets
  - 1. Click **Journals** in the sidebar — the feed opens with today first. Click into today's first bullet and type what happened or what you mean to do.
  - 2. Press **Enter** for the next bullet, **Tab** / **Shift+Tab** to nest or flatten it.
  - 3. What you should see: the text saves to today's journal file on its own — there is no Save button. For where writes go and what happens if a file changes on disk, see [[Reference/Files, external edits, and backups]].
- ## Not at your desk? Quick capture
  - When a thought arrives while you are in another app, press your desktop quick-capture shortcut, type, and the note is appended to today's journal without switching windows. One-time setup, the optional page-title field, and the Enter-key tuning are all in [[Features/Quick capture]].
- ## Turn a bullet into a task
  - 1. With the caret anywhere in a bullet, press **Ctrl+Enter** (Cmd on Mac). The bullet becomes `TODO …`; press again for `DOING`, again for `DONE`, once more to drop the marker. (Under the NOW / LATER workflow the cycle is LATER → NOW → DONE.)
  - 2. Prefer the mouse? Click the marker chip to toggle between the workflow's two open states (TODO ↔ DOING or LATER ↔ NOW), or click the checkbox in front of the task to finish it in one step.
  - 3. Select several blocks first and the same keypress cycles every selected task at once.
  - 4. What you should see: a colored marker chip at the start of the block, plus an empty checkbox until the task is done.
- ## Rank it
  - Type **/** and choose **Priority A** (or B, C) — the marker line becomes `TODO [#A] Call the bank`.
  - What you should see: a colored `[#A]` chip right after the marker; swap it by running the command again.
- ## Give it a date
  - 1. Type **/** and choose **Scheduled**, then pick the day in the calendar popup — use **Add time** if the hour matters.
  - 2. Add **Deadline** the same way when the task has a hard due date.
  - 3. What you should see: a small calendar chip next to the block for each date. Click a chip any time to change or remove it.
- ## Try it: from bullets to an open-task query
	- Copy this Guide into your graph and look at these example tasks:
	- TODO [#A] Collect the audit receipts
		SCHEDULED: <2026-08-12 Wed>
	- TODO Book the flights
		DEADLINE: <2026-08-15 Sat>
	- LATER Read the harvest notes
	- Water the office plants
		SCHEDULED: <2026-08-12 Wed +1w>
	- Then this query lists them:
	- {{query (task TODO DOING NOW LATER)}}
	- What you should see: the marked tasks above, plus tasks elsewhere in the graph that use `TODO`, `DOING`, `NOW`, or `LATER` (the [[Feature showcase]] has a few; a copied Guide adds your own). The query scans the whole graph for those four markers; DONE tasks and tasks using other markers do not appear.
- ## See the plan: the Agenda
  - 1. Scroll to the bottom of today's journal: the **Scheduled &amp; Deadline** list shows open items whose date is near today, wherever in the graph they were written.
  - 2. What you should see: your dated tasks, each with its date chip; click one to jump to it. Widen or narrow the range in Settings → **Journals** → **Agenda window** (default: a week back and a week ahead).
- ## Carry-over: let unfinished tasks follow you
  - 1. Scroll to a past day in the feed and click **Carry unfinished tasks → today** under its title. Blocks with open markers move to today; DONE and CANCELED stay put.
  - 2. What you should see: a "Carried N items to today" toast — or "No unfinished tasks to carry" if none were open.
  - 3. Variants: on today, **Carry from previous day** pulls yesterday in; **Carry last N days** goes further back (N is set in Settings, default 7). The same action is on a journal's right-click menu, and the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) has 7 / 30 / 365-day presets.
  - Settings → **Journals** also tunes it: hide the buttons (the right-click menu keeps working), move the whole block with its context or just the task line, add a “Carried over” heading.
- ## Where everything lives
  - All of this remains plain text. Journal entries use the graph's configured journal directory; tasks on ordinary pages stay in their own Markdown or Org files. Within a task, the marker comes first, then `[#A]`, then the `SCHEDULED:`/`DEADLINE:` lines — readable by Logseq and by any editor. The companion reference page [[Reference/Journals, tasks, and scheduling]] maps the marker set, repeaters, time tracking, and the stored query behind the Agenda. If something looks wrong — a banner, a conflict copy, a duplicate day — [[Reference/Troubleshooting and recovery]] has the recovery steps.
