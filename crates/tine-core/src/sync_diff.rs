//! Structural, block-level 2-way diff between a page (the "winner", kept in the
//! graph) and a sync-tool conflict copy (Syncthing/Dropbox) of it. Feeds the
//! conflict-merge UI (see `docs/plans/sync-conflict-merge.md`).
//!
//! This is NOT a text-blob diff: it aligns the two BLOCK TREES so the UI can
//! offer per-block keep-mine / keep-theirs / keep-both, and so the resolve step
//! can rebuild a merged tree by re-deriving the SAME alignment and applying the
//! user's per-row decisions (the diff and the apply are symmetric — both are a
//! pure function of the two parsed docs, so a row id means the same thing to
//! both). See `Graph::resolve_sync_conflict`.
//!
//! Matching (per the plan's 3-level scheme), applied to each SIBLING list:
//!   L1  same persisted `id::` (strongest anchor — a conflict copy shares the
//!       winner's ids) OR content-equal subtree → an anchor.
//!   L2  in the gaps between anchors, pair by first-line similarity
//!       (normalized Levenshtein > 0.8) → a *modified* hunk.
//!   L3  whatever is left: present only in the winner → *added*; present only in
//!       the conflict → *removed*. Never silently dropped.
//! Anchored/paired rows with both sides present recurse into their children.
//!
//! Complexity: LCS uses Hirschberg reconstruction (O(k²) time, O(k) memory).
//! Similarity pairing is exact for ordinary gaps and falls back to a linear,
//! no-data-loss alignment when a gap would require excessive pair comparisons.
