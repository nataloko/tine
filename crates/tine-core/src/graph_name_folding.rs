//! Does this graph's filesystem tell two page file names apart?
//!
//! Android CI run 32123012366 established that it does not always. The managed
//! storage journey writes two page files whose names differ only by case, and
//! on Android shared storage (`/storage/emulated/0/Download/…`) the second
//! write landed on the FIRST file:
//!
//! ```text
//! graph filesystem folds two journey page names into one file:
//! pages/K\u{16f}\u{148} b\u{11b}\u{17e}\u{ed}.md reads back the bytes written
//! for pages/k\u{16f}\u{148} b\u{11b}\u{17e}\u{ed}.md (18 bytes, not 8)
//! ```
//!
//! That is a platform fact, not a Tine defect, and it is not confined to
//! Android: FAT/exFAT removable media, NTFS, APFS in its default configuration
//! and any `ext4` directory with the casefold attribute all fold case, and
//! HFS+ additionally normalizes. So the question "would this filesystem hold
//! both of these two names?" has to be ASKED rather than assumed, and asked
//! once per filesystem rather than once per file.
//!
//! ## Why this is not, by itself, a data-safety hole
//!
//! Tine's logical page name is already case- and normalization-insensitive:
//! [`crate::oplog::LogicalPageName::key_digest`] hashes
//! `canonical_page_name_key`, which lowercases (char-wise — it diverges from
//! Logseq's/`refs::page_key`'s contextual fold on Greek final sigma; see the
//! fold's own doc, DUP-1) and then applies NFC.
//! **Every pair of file names a case-folding or normalization-folding
//! filesystem cannot tell apart is therefore a pair Tine already treats as ONE
//! page.** Such a filesystem cannot merge two distinct Tine pages, because two
//! names that it folds were never two pages here.
//!
//! What it does change is that the non-authoritative DUPLICATE file — the one
//! `retain_authoritative_desired_pages` deliberately leaves on disk as ordinary
//! graph text with no page of its own — cannot exist on that filesystem at all.
//! Whoever wrote the second spelling (a sync client, a file manager, the user)
//! overwrote the authoritative file instead. Tine never saw two files and
//! cannot report a merge it has no evidence of; see
//! `docs/storage-sync-contract.md` §2.10d for the contract this module states.
//!
//! ## What the probe is for
//!
//! Three things, in descending order of weight:
//!
//! 1. Naming the platform fact in receipts, so a device round trip is not the
//!    only way to learn it.
//! 2. Letting a fixture — the managed storage journey above all — write a tree
//!    the filesystem can actually hold, and then assert the PRODUCT behavior on
//!    that tree instead of refusing to run.
//! 3. Letting a refusal that is really about folding say so in the user's
//!    words.
//!
//! The answer is never load-bearing for correctness. A probe that cannot run
//! answers [`GraphNameFolding::UNKNOWN`], which is the same shape as "this
//! filesystem folds nothing", and every caller degrades to the behavior it had
//! before this module existed.
