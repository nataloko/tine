//! **The one fixture set both visible-column resolvers must agree on** (P5A).
//!
//! `tine.columns::` owns the ordered list of columns a query block SHOWS;
//! `tine.fields::` keeps the typed sheet schema. Three consumers read that
//! precedence — the §4.1 property merge (`query::view`), the static publisher
//! (`publish.rs`), and the app's query table — and two of them are in Rust
//! while the third is in TypeScript. Rust has exactly one implementation
//! (`query::view::resolve_query_columns`, which `publish.rs` calls rather than
//! copying); TypeScript has an adapter at the existing cross-language boundary
//! (`src/editor/queryViewProperties.ts`), because rendering a table is a
//! synchronous walk over blocks already in memory and cannot take an IPC
//! round-trip per block.
//!
//! What makes that pair legitimate rather than a twin is THIS FILE: one fixture
//! set, read by `src/editor/queryViewProperties.test.ts` and by the test below.
//! If the two readers ever disagree about which columns a note selects, one of
//! these two tests goes red — and a published page silently showing different
//! columns from the app is exactly the failure the pinning exists to prevent.
