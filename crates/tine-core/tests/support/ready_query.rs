//! The public Direct query route, from an integration test (RET2).
//!
//! **Why this exists.** RET2 retired the parsed-graph walk from every public
//! Direct query. `Graph::run_query` and friends now answer from the SQLite
//! projection or return a typed `query::QueryExecutionError`, so an integration
//! fixture that opens a graph and asks a question has to do what the app does:
//! attach the projection, let it initialize, and retry only while the error is
//! `NotReady`. A fixture that instead reached for the walk to stay green would
//! be reconnecting the oracle at the test boundary, which is the one thing the
//! no-production-traversal amendment forbids.
//!
//! **Why the retry is the readiness gate.** `direct_projection_ready_test` is
//! `pub(crate)` and compiled only under the crate's own `cfg(test)`, so an
//! integration test (a separate crate, built against the ordinary library)
//! cannot see it. The typed error IS the public readiness signal — it is the
//! same one `src/queryReadiness.ts` loops on — so the fixture loops on exactly
//! that and fails immediately on anything else. No new public API is invented
//! for the tests' benefit.
