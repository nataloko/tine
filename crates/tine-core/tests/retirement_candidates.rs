//! The `// RETIREMENT-CANDIDATE:` census.
//!
//! Martin, 2026-09-03: *"also write it in the code, so that a future sweep
//! discovers 'there is a comment saying this should get deleted eventually; is
//! now the time?'"* The convention only works if the set of markers is pinned:
//! an unpinned marker can be added without anyone agreeing that the code is
//! temporary, and — much worse — can be silently deleted along with the code it
//! was warning about. Both are deliberate acts, so both fail here first.
//!
//! The convention's first deliberate use was the `simple_query_candidate_paths`
//! hatch in `direct_projection.rs`, and it worked exactly as intended: RET2
//! deleted the Direct query walk, the hatch's stated CONDITION was met, and the
//! hatch, its marker and this row all went with it. The pre-SQL candidate
//! planner in `query.rs` retired the same way once the SQL route took over its
//! work, and so did the in-memory query walk's marker when K2 (2026-09-15)
//! compiled the walk out of the product: it is a test-only oracle now, not
//! temporary production code. No marker is live today. A new one states WHAT
//! may be deleted, the CONDITION that makes it deletable, and WHAT CURRENTLY
//! BLOCKS deletion — the last being the part a future sweep actually needs,
//! because a marker that only says "delete me eventually" tells the sweep
//! nothing about whether now is the time.
//!
//! Pinned by `(file, marker text)` and never by line number: a line-anchored
//! pin reddens on every unrelated packet that edits the file above it, which is
//! a tax with no signal.

         delete this?\" and get an answer instead of a guess. Every marker \
         states three things — WHAT may be deleted, the CONDITION under which \
         it becomes deletable, and WHAT CURRENTLY BLOCKS deletion. The blocker \
         is the load-bearing part; without it the sweep cannot tell a ready \
         retirement from a premature one.\n\
         \n\
         Adding a marker and deleting one are both deliberate acts, so both \
         update this list. If you deleted the code, delete its row. If you \
         added a marker, add its row and state the three parts named in \
