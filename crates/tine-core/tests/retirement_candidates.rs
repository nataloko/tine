//! The `// RETIREMENT-CANDIDATE:` census.
//!
//! Martin, 2026-09-03: *"also write it in the code, so that a future sweep
//! discovers 'there is a comment saying this should get deleted eventually; is
//! now the time?'"* The convention only works if the set of markers is pinned:
//! an unpinned marker can be added without anyone agreeing that the code is
//! temporary, and — much worse — can be silently deleted along with the code it
//! was warning about. Both are deliberate acts, so both fail here first.
//!
//! This is the first deliberate use of the convention, so the exemplar is the
//! `simple_query_candidate_paths` hatch in `direct_projection.rs`. Copy its
//! shape: WHAT may be deleted, the CONDITION that makes it deletable, and WHAT
//! CURRENTLY BLOCKS deletion — the last being the part a future sweep actually
//! needs, because a marker that only says "delete me eventually" tells the
//! sweep nothing about whether now is the time.
//!
//! Pinned by `(file, marker text)` and never by line number: a line-anchored
//! pin reddens on every unrelated packet that edits the file above it, which is
//! a tax with no signal.

         The convention: a `{MARKER}` comment marks production code that is \
         known to be temporary, so a future sweep can ask \"is now the time to \
         delete this?\" and get an answer instead of a guess. Every marker \
         states three things — WHAT may be deleted, the CONDITION under which \
         it becomes deletable, and WHAT CURRENTLY BLOCKS deletion. The blocker \
         is the load-bearing part; without it the sweep cannot tell a ready \
         retirement from a premature one.\n\
         \n\
         Adding a marker and deleting one are both deliberate acts, so both \
         update this list. If you deleted the code, delete its row. If you \
         added a marker, add its row and copy the exemplar's shape: \
         `crates/tine-core/src/direct_projection.rs`, on the candidate-count \
         escape hatch in `simple_query_candidate_paths`.\n\
         \n\
         I-12: this census uses the one production-source scanner \
         (`tests/support/production_source.rs`); do not add a second walker."
