// This census used to pin `{ file, lines }` — 76 absolute line numbers, half of
// them in `model.rs`, `hot_engine.rs` and `sqlite.rs`, the three files every
// lane edits. Inserting a line anywhere above one of them turned the census red
// for work that never touched logging, and the repair was a script that
// re-anchored the numbers mechanically. A guard whose normal failure mode is
// "run the fixer" is a guard nobody reads: the I-12 test thirty lines below
// already says exactly this in its own comment, and already anchors on the
// function. This now does the same, and `scripts/reanchor-print-census.mjs` is
// deleted rather than kept as a tempting shortcut.
//
// A function name is also a better classification unit than a line: `why` can be
// checked against the function it names, which a line number cannot support.
// The census still moves when a print is ADDED to, REMOVED from, or MOVED
// BETWEEN functions — each of which is a real change to what a shipped binary
// can emit, and each of which deserves a human classification.
