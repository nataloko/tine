// One answer to "open the page named N" for every native E2E journey.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (flake census, 2026-09-04). Sixteen `scripts/e2e-*.mjs` files
// each carried their own navigate/openPage/gotoPage helper, with nine distinct
// switcher-row selector strings, timeouts from 5s to 60s, NFC normalization in
// three of them, and three different ways of activating a row. A readiness bug
// found in one of those copies was therefore never fixed in the other fifteen,
// which is the actual reason E2E flakes keep costing whole release cycles: the
// fix has no single place to land.
//
// THE FLAKE THIS REMOVES. Quick Switcher results come from a `createResource`
// keyed on a debounced query, rendered through `<For each={section.items}>`
// (src/components/QuickSwitcher.tsx). Solid's `For` is keyed by reference, so
// when the resource resolves it REPLACES the row elements. WebDriver's
// `setValue` types character by character, and each keystroke can settle its own
// query — so a harness that does `$(row).waitForExist()` and then `row.click()`
// can capture a row from an intermediate result set and click a node that has
// since been detached. Nothing happens, and the journey fails 10 seconds later
// on the page title, not on the row. `e2e-right-sidebar-collapse.mjs` is the
// type specimen precisely because it opens "Page A" then "Page B": the shared
// prefix means an intermediate result set already contains a row whose name
// matches exactly, so the early capture looks correct.
//
// THE RULE THIS ENCODES. Never hold an element handle across a list that
// re-renders. Find and activate in ONE `browser.execute` round trip, treat the
// routed page title as the readiness predicate, and retry the whole atomic
// selection until that predicate holds. Retrying is safe because selecting a
// row is idempotent.
//
// It also fixes, once, three things that were right in some copies and wrong in
// others: block hits are excluded (a block whose text contains the page title
// outranked the page itself and broke the hosted Windows reporter-scale
// journey), names are compared NFC-normalized (macOS/Linux filename twins), and
// `[[ ]]` link decoration is tolerated when routing through a rendered link,
// since `:ui/show-brackets?` defaults to on.
