# live OUTSIDE the repo, on a persistent mount (NOT ~/.cargo, which is wiped on
# container rebuild) — by default a `.toolchain/` dir alongside the repo.
# If that local toolchain is unavailable and no override is supplied, retain the
# caller environment (for example, the Rust toolchain configured by CI).
#
# Override the location by exporting TINE_TOOLCHAIN before sourcing, e.g.
#   TINE_TOOLCHAIN=$HOME/.tine-toolchain source scripts/env.sh

# default the toolchain to a sibling `.toolchain/` of the primary checkout.
# Linked agent worktrees live under `tine-agent-worktrees/`, so their immediate
# sibling is not the persistent toolchain. Git's common dir points back to the
# primary checkout and keeps the same script valid in both layouts.
