# Apple distribution

Tine's existing Linux, Windows, and Android name remains **Tine**. The iOS App
Store product and home-screen display name is **TineOutline**, using the same
bundle identifier, `page.tine.Tine`.

This document covers the two independent Apple paths:

- the ordinary release workflow signs and notarizes the direct-download macOS
  `.app` and `.dmg` with a Developer ID Application certificate;
- the manual iOS TestFlight workflow signs an IPA with an Apple Distribution
  certificate and App Store Connect provisioning profile.

Neither workflow submits a production App Store release. TestFlight upload only
places a build in App Store Connect for processing and testing.

## Repository secrets

The GitHub repository must contain these encrypted Actions secrets:

| Secret | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded password-protected Developer ID `.p12` |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for that `.p12` |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | Full Developer ID Application signing identity |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Ten-character Apple team ID |
| `APPLE_API_KEY` | App Store Connect API key ID |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER` | App Store Connect issuer UUID |
| `APPLE_API_PRIVATE_KEY` | Complete downloaded `AuthKey_*.p8` contents |
| `IOS_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded password-protected Apple Distribution `.p12` |
| `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for that `.p12` |
| `IOS_MOBILE_PROVISION` | Base64-encoded App Store Connect provisioning profile |
| `APP_STORE_APPLE_ID` | Numeric App Store Connect app ID, for release tooling that needs it |

Private keys and passwords must never be committed, uploaded as workflow
artifacts, printed, or copied into issue logs. Workflows materialize the API key
only in a runner-private directory, set mode `0600`, and delete it in an
`always()` cleanup step.

## macOS direct-download release

`.github/workflows/release.yml` uses the ordinary release matrix. The macOS lane
fails if any Developer ID or App Store Connect notarization secret is missing.
Tauri signs and notarizes the universal app, then the workflow independently
checks the code signature, Developer ID authority, team ID, stapled ticket,
Gatekeeper assessment, and DMG integrity before staging the release lane.

The normal exact-SHA full-CI and release-readiness gates still apply. Do not tag
or publish merely to test credentials; use a manual release smoke on an approved
candidate after its exact commit has passed full CI.

## TestFlight

Run **Actions → iOS TestFlight → Run workflow** and choose one action:

- `build-only` (default): build and verify a signed IPA, then retain it as an
  immutable workflow artifact;
- `validate`: also ask App Store Connect to validate the IPA;
- `upload`: validate and upload it for TestFlight processing.

The build number is the unique GitHub Actions run number. Re-running the same
workflow therefore produces a new App Store build without changing Tine's user
version. The workflow verifies the bundle ID, `TineOutline` display name,
encryption declaration, privacy manifest, provisioning profile, team, and code
signature before it can validate or upload anything.

The first iOS beta deliberately keeps the Wasm plugin host and plugin catalogue
off, as required by ADR 0052. Declarative built-in and token themes remain. Do
not enable iOS plugins as part of release preparation; that decision requires
the separate Apple guideline 4.7 catalogue, reporting, age-rating, and review
work recorded by the ADR.

### iCloud Drive capability

The first useful TestFlight build supports exactly two graph roots owned by
TineOutline:

- `On My iPhone/iPad → TineOutline`;
- `iCloud Drive → TineOutline`, backed by `iCloud.page.tine.Tine`.

The iCloud location is the folder picker's recommended starting point when the
device is signed in to iCloud. Tine prepares ubiquitous files before handing the
graph to the ordinary guarded storage path; conflict handling remains Concord's
job just as it is for another provider-delivered external edit. Arbitrary Files
providers are intentionally outside this first boundary: Dropbox, Google Drive,
OneDrive, Working Copy and similar roots require persisted security-scoped
bookmarks and coordination that Tine does not yet implement. State this on the
Welcome screen, when refusing an outside-container folder, and in TestFlight
beta notes; do not present it as a warning about iCloud or ordinary conflicts.

Before a signed build can pass, Apple Developer must contain an iCloud container
with identifier `iCloud.page.tine.Tine`, the `page.tine.Tine` App ID must enable
iCloud Documents and associate that container, and the App Store Connect
provisioning profile must be regenerated. Replace `IOS_MOBILE_PROVISION` after
regeneration. The workflow installs the tracked entitlements into Tauri's
generated Xcode project and verifies that both the profile and final signature
authorize the exact container and `CloudDocuments` service.

An upload is not the end of TestFlight setup. In App Store Connect, wait for
processing, answer any export-compliance prompt, complete the app privacy and
beta-review information, select internal or external testers, and submit an
external beta for Beta App Review when Apple requires it. Production App Store
submission and release remain separate manual decisions.

## Integration gates

Before this branch is merged:

1. `https://tine.page/privacy.html` must be deployed and readable.
2. `support@tine.page` must receive and send a test reply.
3. A manual macOS candidate must pass signing, notarization, and Gatekeeper
   verification on GitHub's macOS runner, then be opened on a real Mac.
4. The iCloud App ID/container association must exist and the regenerated
   provisioning profile must replace `IOS_MOBILE_PROVISION`.
5. The TestFlight workflow must pass `build-only`, then `validate`; upload needs
   Martin's explicit choice and a real iPhone smoke test.
6. App Store Connect metadata, screenshots, privacy answers, and review notes
   remain subject to Martin's approval.
