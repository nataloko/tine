# Managed read surface

This contract pins the production `application_*` family. A live row is either
`necessary` because it owns a Managed-only input/index boundary, or an `adapter`
whose body delegates to the named shared owner. New twins are prohibited by
I-12 and D-4. The syntactic guard uses
`projection_producer_census::production_rust()` and verifies membership and
adapter call edges.

## UUID ownership policy

| boundary | exact outcome/rule | OG commit | OG path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct-ready | Physical projection is a hint; ambiguity falls back and parser-order first claimant owns the UUID. | c67b8b5fa47f8fe1e1954226c9bdfabd46ebb968 | `deps/graph-parser/src/logseq/graph_parser/block.cljs` (`fix-block-id-if-duplicated!`) |
| Direct-fallback | Parser-order first claimant owns the UUID. | c67b8b5fa47f8fe1e1954226c9bdfabd46ebb968 | `deps/graph-parser/src/logseq/graph_parser/block.cljs` (`fix-block-id-if-duplicated!`) |
| Managed-pending | Merge exact overlay and SQLite pages in graph path/tree order; first claimant owns the UUID. | c67b8b5fa47f8fe1e1954226c9bdfabd46ebb968 | `deps/graph-parser/src/logseq/graph_parser/block.cljs` (`fix-block-id-if-duplicated!`) |
| Managed-drained | A unique SQLite hint is accepted; ambiguity is resolved from pages in graph path/tree order, first claimant. | c67b8b5fa47f8fe1e1954226c9bdfabd46ebb968 | `deps/graph-parser/src/logseq/graph_parser/block.cljs` (`fix-block-id-if-duplicated!`) |

OG also declares `:block/uuid` unique identity in
`deps/db/src/logseq/db/schema.cljs`; the parser establishes which claimant keeps
the UUID before that identity enters the database.

## Template extraction policy

| boundary | exact outcome/rule | OG commit | OG path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Property extraction | Normalize property keys to lowercase and replace slash, spaces, and underscores with hyphens. | c67b8b5fa47f8fe1e1954226c9bdfabd46ebb968 | `deps/graph-parser/src/logseq/graph_parser/block.cljs` and `deps/graph-parser/src/logseq/graph_parser/extract.cljc` |
| Template discovery | A parsed block whose normalized property map contains `template` is a template; ordinary page pre-block text is not a block template. | c67b8b5fa47f8fe1e1954226c9bdfabd46ebb968 | `src/main/frontend/db/model.cljs` (`get-all-templates`) |

## Measured exception

`shallow_application_block` remains at exactly four syntactically pinned
Managed result boundaries (W4-C7b retired the fifth with the managed
block-referrer twin). The DTO already contains parser-derived facets;
routing through `dto_block_to_doc_block` plus `block_to_shallow_dto` creates one
temporary `DocBlock` per result and reparses raw text. See
`managed_shallow_application_block_manual_probe` and
`measurement-shallow-application-block.txt`. This is a measured keep under D-4,
not permission for another shallow producer.

## `BlockDto::id` is a runtime handle, not a durable identity

The two modes put different values in this one wire field, and both are
correct:

| mode | `BlockDto::id` | durable `id::` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct | the projection's `block_id` (a runtime identity; `direct_projection.rs` keeps `logseq_uuid` as a separate column) | in `properties`, unchanged |
| Managed | the durable `id::` uuid where the block has one | in `properties`, unchanged |

Nothing user-facing depends on the difference: every reference-producing path
goes through `ensureBlockId` (`src/store.ts`), which reads the existing `id::`
out of the block's raw text — case-insensitively — and never writes a second
one, precisely so a copied `((ref))` cannot dangle.

**The rule for new consumers:** treat `BlockDto::id` as a handle valid for the
current session and mode only. Anything that persists, exports, or compares a
block identity across modes must read the `id` entry of `properties`. The
real-graph gate `managed_c7a_real_graph_copy_manual_gate` normalizes this field
out of its parity oracle for exactly this reason; if a future packet needs the
two modes to agree on it, that is a deliberate identity change, not a bug fix.

## W4-C7b measured collapse

One evaluator per question, measured before and after on the same machine. The
gate is the structural column — how many production functions own the algorithm.
Timing is advisory: this machine builds other worktrees concurrently.

Runtime counters come from `c7b_measure_managed_and_direct_reads` (30 indexed
pages + 5 journals, one cold pass and nine warm passes) and
`c7b_measure_anonymized_corpus` (1,045-page real graph, one cold pass and four
warm). `allocation_calls` / `allocated_bytes` are a `#[cfg(test)]` counting
global allocator defined in `sync_runtime_tests.rs::c7b_alloc`; no allocation
counter existed anywhere under `crates/` to reuse.
