# Architecture Decision Records

Short, append-only notes on the **load-bearing** decisions behind Tine — the ones
where knowing *why* matters later, so we (and contributors, and the AI that does
much of the implementation) don't silently undo a deliberate choice.

This is **not** a log of every decision. Record one when a choice is architectural
and would be expensive or risky to reverse — a framework, a data-flow boundary, a
format commitment, a safety invariant. Skip the rest.

## Format

One file per decision, `NNNN-short-title.md`, using
[Michael Nygard's template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
(see [`template.md`](template.md)): **Context → Decision → Consequences**, plus a
**Status**. Keep it to a screen. Don't edit a decided record to change its meaning;
if a decision is reversed, add a *new* ADR that supersedes it and flip the old one's
status to `Superseded by NNNN`.

## When to write one

When a load-bearing decision is actually made (not when it's merely floated). If
you're the AI implementing such a change, write the ADR in the same chunk of work —
see the project `CLAUDE.md`.

**Fork (`mine`) ADRs** — this fork's own extras keep a separate numbering track so upstream syncs
never collide: see [`mine/README.md`](mine/README.md).
