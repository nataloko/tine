# Android release signing

Debug APKs are signed with the shared, publicly-known Android *debug* key. On a
phone that triggers Play Protect's harsh "unsafe app / unknown developer" wall
(the one where **Install anyway** is buried). A **release build signed with our
own key** removes the debug-cert stigma, gives Tine a stable identity, and lets
installs update in place. It's also required for F-Droid and the Play Store.

The signing credentials are read from `src-tauri/gen/android/keystore.properties`,
which is **gitignored** — no key or password is ever committed. Without that file,
`build.gradle.kts` still builds, but the release APK comes out unsigned.

## One-time setup (do this once; you own the key)

**1. Generate a release keystore** (keep it OUTSIDE the repo; back it up somewhere
safe — if you lose it you can never ship an update under the same identity, and if
it leaks someone can publish malicious "Tine updates"):

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.android-keys
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore ~/.android-keys/tine-release.jks \
  -alias tine \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -dname "CN=Tine, O=Tine, C=CZ"
```

It prompts for a keystore password (and a key password — you can reuse the same).
Remember them; they go in the properties file below.

**2. Create `src-tauri/gen/android/keystore.properties`** (gitignored) with:

```properties
storeFile=/home/koutecky/.android-keys/tine-release.jks
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyAlias=tine
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
```

Use an **absolute** `storeFile` path. That's it — the build picks it up
automatically.

## Building a signed release

With the Android env exported (see `subagent-tasks` / the build memo), from the
repo root:

```sh
# Signed release APK (sideload / F-Droid):
CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_STRIP=symbols npx tauri android build --target aarch64 --apk
#   → src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release.apk

# Signed release AAB (Play Store, later):
npx tauri android build --target aarch64 --aab
```

Note: **no `--debug`** — that's what makes it a release build. Verify it's signed
with your key (not the debug key):

```sh
$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/35.0.0/apksigner verify --print-certs \
  src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release.apk
```

The printed certificate DN should be `CN=Tine, …`, not `CN=Android Debug`.

## Delivering a test APK to Martin

`~/research/tine.apk` is the stable Syncthing delivery path for the current
Android test build, parallel to `~/research/tine` for the desktop binary. After
the exact APK has passed the required checks and its release signature has been
verified, retain the versioned artifact and copy it to the stable path:

```sh
cp -f /path/to/exact-signed.apk ~/research/tine.apk
chmod 0644 ~/research/tine.apk
sha256sum /path/to/exact-signed.apk ~/research/tine.apk
```

The two hashes must match. Do not deploy an unsigned, debug-signed, stale, or
different-commit APK to this path.

## Signing in CI (the normal path — GitHub Actions builds signed APKs)

The `release` workflow has an `android` job that builds a **signed** release APK
and attaches it to the GitHub Release on every `v*` tag — no manual signing, and
the private key never touches a build host. The key lives only in GitHub's
encrypted secrets.

**One-time setup** (do it on the machine that holds the `.jks`, so the key never
transits NFS). Add four repo secrets to the GitHub repo (`martinkoutecky/tine`):

```sh
base64 -w0 ~/.android-keys/tine-release.jks | gh secret set ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64 --repo martinkoutecky/tine
gh secret set ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD --repo martinkoutecky/tine   # paste password
gh secret set ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS --repo martinkoutecky/tine --body tine
gh secret set ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD --repo martinkoutecky/tine        # paste password
```

(Or add them via GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.) That's it —
tag a release (`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`) and the signed
`Tine_X.Y.Z_android-arm64.apk` appears on the release. Until `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
is set, the `android` job skips itself and the desktop release proceeds unaffected.

Notes:
- The workflow writes `keystore.properties` from the secrets, builds, and deletes
  the decoded key + properties file at the end of the job.
- For the **Play Store** later, add `--aab` to the build step (produces a signed
  `.aab` to upload to the Play Console). F-Droid signs its own builds, so it needs
  none of this.

## Signing off-machine (when the build host must not hold the key)

The build sandbox on the university machine deliberately does **not** hold the
private key (its home is world-readable NFS). So the key lives only on a private
machine, and we sign there:

1. **On the build host** — build an *unsigned* release APK. Because
   `build.gradle.kts` gates signing on the keystore *file* existing (not just
   `keystore.properties`), a host without the `.jks` produces
   `…/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release-unsigned.apk` cleanly. Ensure
   it's zipaligned before delivery:
   ```sh
   $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/35.0.0/zipalign -c -v 4 app-universal-release-unsigned.apk  # verify
   ```
   (Gradle release packaging already aligns it; the check should pass.)

2. **On the private machine that has the key** — sign with the self-contained
   `apksigner.jar` (needs only a JDK, which you have from `keytool`):
   ```sh
   java -jar apksigner.jar sign \
     --ks ~/.android-keys/tine-release.jks --ks-key-alias tine \
     --out tine-release-signed.apk app-universal-release-unsigned.apk
   ```
   It prompts for the keystore password. Verify:
   ```sh
   java -jar apksigner.jar verify --print-certs tine-release-signed.apk   # → CN=Tine
   ```
   Install `tine-release-signed.apk`. The private key never touches the build host.

## Notes

- Minification (R8/ProGuard) is currently **off** for release: Tauri mobile
  plugins (including our folder picker) are resolved reflectively by class name,
  which R8 can strip without a device to catch it. Re-enable with vetted
  keep-rules once a minified build can be tested on hardware.
- Play Store uses **Play App Signing**: Google holds the final signing key and
  your release key becomes the *upload* key. F-Droid signs with its own key (or
  builds reproducibly). Either way, keep this keystore safe.
